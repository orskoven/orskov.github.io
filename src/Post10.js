      <h2>Navigating the Murky Waters of Cybersecurity Insurance in the Age of Complex Cyber Threats</h2>
      <p>In the evolving landscape of cybersecurity, insurance companies face growing challenges, especially when grappling with the auditing process of cybersecurity measures. Josephine Wolf, a noted expert in the field, brings to light several crucial issues in the current approach to cybersecurity insurance.</p>

      <h3>The Auditing Quandary</h3>
      <p>A fundamental question arises: Can we review cybersecurity protocols sufficiently to justify premiums? Security technology firms provide scanning services, yet insurance companies struggle to extract tangible assurances from software companies about the robustness of their defenses.</p>

      <h3>Risk Pooling and Cybersecurity</h3>
      <p>The insurance industry operates on the principle of risk pooling. However, despite their limited grasp of cyber threats, insurers continue to offer cybersecurity insurance. This sector is among the fastest-growing in the industry, fueled partly by the fear of missing out on significant market opportunities.</p>

      <h3>The Apache Attack and Interconnected Risks</h3>
      <p>The Apache attack on the electric grid—a critical infrastructure—demonstrates the interconnected nature of cyber risks that extend beyond the immediate sector affected. This incident has highlighted the insurance sector's struggle to spread risks across different sectors effectively, as many rely on the same cloud providers.</p>

      <h3>Government Attribution and Insurance Claims</h3>
      <p>The complexity of attributing cyber attacks became evident when it took governments seven months to tentatively attribute the massive Apache attack to Russia. This delay complicates the insurance claims process, particularly when policies exclude acts of war, and the attacker is a state actor.</p>

      <h3>Legal Battles Over War Exclusions</h3>
      <p>Insurance policies often include exclusions for acts of war. The case involving Mondelez International, where insurers refused to pay out claims related to the NotPetya attack—attributed to Russia—underlines the contentious nature of such exclusions. Insurers argue that state-backed cyber attacks fall under these exclusions, drawing parallels with historical legal battles such as the attack on Pearl Harbor, where insurers denied claims on the basis that no formal declaration of war had been made at the time of the attack.</p>

      <h3>The Evolving Legal Landscape</h3>
      <p>Recent legal precedents highlight the difficulty of applying traditional war exclusions to cyber attacks. For instance, in Universal Cable Productions v. Atlantic Specialty Insurance Co., the court ruled that actions by Hamas did not constitute "warlike action by a military force" because they did not represent a sovereign state. Similarly, in Merck v. Ace American Insurance, the court found that the war exclusion did not apply because the insurers had not updated the language of the policy to specifically include cyber attacks, despite the increasing frequency of such incidents.</p>

      <h3>Proposed Changes to Cybersecurity Insurance</h3>
      <p>Given the complexities in attributing cyber attacks and the challenges in defining what constitutes an act of war in cyberspace, there is a call for clearer insurance policy language. New exclusions should specifically cover state-backed cyber attacks that significantly impair state functions or security capabilities, and clarity is needed on whether these exclusions apply to computer systems outside the affected state.</p>

      <p>As cyber threats continue to evolve, both in sophistication and in the actors involved, the insurance industry must adapt by developing more precise policy terms and engaging with experts from various fields to better define and categorize cyber events. This collaborative approach could enhance the industry’s ability to manage cyber risks effectively and equitably.</p>

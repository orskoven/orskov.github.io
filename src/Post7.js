      <h2>Vestas: Advocating for Effective Cybersecurity Practices Amidst Rising Threats</h2>
      <p>As cybersecurity threats grow more sophisticated, leading wind turbine manufacturer Vestas urges not to reduce the NIS2 directive—a key EU cybersecurity legislation—to mere paperwork. Instead, Vestas emphasizes the need for practical implementation, as highlighted by their Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).</p>

      <h3>Recent Cyber Attack on Vestas</h3>
      <p>Vestas recently faced a cyber attack that underscored the vulnerabilities in the energy sector. This incident has propelled calls for harmonized legislation across different regions, including Asia and the USA, to stabilize and align cybersecurity laws effectively.</p>

      <h3>The Push for Open Information Sharing</h3>
      <p>Vestas advocates for increased openness and cross-sector information sharing about cybersecurity incidents. Such transparency is deemed crucial in fortifying defenses across the entire value chain, particularly within the energy sector.</p>

      <h3>Cybersecurity by Design</h3>
      <p>The concept of "security by design" is gaining traction, suggesting that cybersecurity should be an integral part of the energy systems’ design process. This approach includes considering the lifespan and structural integrity of wind turbines, where regulatory standardization and compliance with cybersecurity measures are built-in from the outset.</p>

      <h3>Economic Factors and Cybersecurity</h3>
      <p>Vestas' CISO also sheds light on the economic implications of cybersecurity. As energy prices fluctuate and the market adapts to new normals—like the historical zero interest rates—there is a need to factor in stable energy supply costs more than ever. This stability should not solely depend on market prices but also include robust cybersecurity measures as mandated by the NIS2 directive in wind turbine tenders.</p>

      <h3>Physical vs. Cyber Threats</h3>
      <p>From a risk perspective, cyber threats are increasingly viewed as more opportune than physical threats due to their remote and covert nature. Vestas quantifies cyber risks alongside other business risks, highlighting the importance of securing assets, particularly aging ones in the field.</p>

      <h3>Technological Debt and Crisis Management</h3>
      <p>Vestas acknowledges the technological debt embedded in turbine systems, often due to outdated software disciplines. The normal server systems have shown vulnerabilities, prompting a reevaluation of crisis management strategies. There’s a push to holistically address both IT and operational technology (OT) risks, acknowledging legacy issues in existing turbines.</p>

      <h3>Challenges in Communication and Control During Crises</h3>
      <p>The CISO points out several areas for improvement in crisis communication and control. The ability to escalate response measures as a crisis unfolds is crucial. Language barriers and a lack of proper crisis training can hinder effective management. Vestas stresses the importance of a well-trained, cohesive crisis team that trusts each other.</p>

      <h3>Future Directions</h3>
      <p>As Vestas navigates the challenges of mergers and acquisitions, maintaining control and spreading cybersecurity parameters slowly are vital. Establishing standard processes for restoring critical points attacked during cybersecurity incidents is a priority.</p>

      <p>In conclusion, Vestas is at the forefront of integrating cybersecurity into its business model, advocating for legislative harmonization, and enhancing crisis management capabilities to safeguard the future of energy infrastructure.</p>

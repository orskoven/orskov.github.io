            <h2>I‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• Computers</h2>
            <p>A student of code, an explorer of bytes, I traverse the landscapes of technology. Inspired by the great Hemingway's brevity and wit, I shape the world of digital narratives. Whether it's in class as an engaged computer science student or in my YouTube tutorials at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@spilledbeans" class="youtube-link">SpilledBeans</a>, I unravel the complexity of coding into simple truths.</p>
            <p>Extroverted and a team player, I thrive in collaboration. My skills are not just confined to the screen, but extend to relationships, building connections, one code line at a time.</p>
            <p>I'm an aspiring computer science AP student, a lover of Apple, coding,           tech, and the endless wonders of the internet. In the quiet corners of my room, you'll find me playing a soft melody on the guitar or diving into a gripping novel. But when I lace up my running shoes or indulge in a movie, my love for life's simpler pleasures shines through.

            <p>A student of code, an explorer of bytes, I traverse the landscapes of technology. Inspired by the great Hemingway's brevity and wit, I shape the world of digital narratives. Whether it's in class as an engaged computer science student or in my YouTube tutorials at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@spilledbeans" class="youtube-link">SpilledBeans</a>, I unravel the complexity of coding into simple truths.</p>
            <p>Extroverted and a team player, I thrive in collaboration. My skills are not just confined to the screen, but extend to relationships, building connections, one code line at a time.</p>

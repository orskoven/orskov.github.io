      <h2>Morten, Coach of the Cyber National Team</h2>
      <p>Morten, a coach of the cyber national team, shared insights into the intense world of cybersecurity competitions, specifically Capture The Flag (CTF) tournaments which are ongoing and feature continuous engagement.</p>

      <h3>Competition Structure and Strategy</h3>
      <p>The competition involves both attack and defense strategies where teams must exploit servers while defending their own. Morten highlighted the success of team "Norsecode," which ranked sixth in a recent tournament. Unlike traditional cybersecurity roles that may focus on defense, these competitions emphasize offensive skills, simulating real-time cyber attacks and defenses that intensify every three minutes with new challenges.</p>

      <h3>Technical Setup and Team Dynamics</h3>
      <p>Teams operate in a high-stakes environment where maintaining uptime is crucial. Shutting down systems, even briefly, results in severe penalties. Strategies include hacking opponents to inflict penalties on them as well. All these activities are connected through a large VPN, shielded by firewalls.</p>
      <p>The infrastructure includes a Docker registry that needs to be deployed on the server, and part of the strategy involves analyzing and potentially exploiting the software versions of competitors' systems. Winning strategies often involve adopting techniques from the second-best teams rather than the top performers, aiming for consistent, high-level performance across various aspects of the competition.</p>

      <h3>Physical and Operational Security</h3>
      <p>Physical presence and coordination are key in these competitions. With teams traditionally structured similar to corporate IT departments (blue teams for defense, red teams for attack, network teams for infrastructure), coordination and real-time communication are essential. The venue, often a rented suite, becomes a bustling hub of 35 team members or more, underscoring the scale and intensity of these events.</p>

      <h3>Tooling and Security</h3>
      <p>Morten's team has developed its own set of tools, inspired by Nordic mythology, to ensure robust security practices within their operations. Operational security is a top priority, particularly to safeguard against internal threats. This includes maintaining all critical information in memory to boost performance and prevent data leaks.</p>

      <h3>Innovative Competition Tactics</h3>
      <p>The competition's dynamic environment includes elements like manipulating network traffic to mislead opponents with false flags or decoys, sophisticated dashboard setups that remain hidden from competitors, and advanced scoring systems that track teams' actions in real-time.</p>

      <h3>Future and Continuous Improvement</h3>
      <p>Looking forward, the focus is on refining strategies and tools, with an emphasis on binary exploitationâ€”an area seen as prestigious within the community. Teams are careful about revealing their tactics and exploits, especially against top-tier competitors, opting instead to test strategies against lower-ranked teams to gauge effectiveness without exposing their hand.</p>

      <p>In sum, Morten's approach to coaching in cybersecurity competitions encapsulates a blend of technical acumen, strategic foresight, and rigorous team management, all set against the backdrop of a fast-paced and continuously evolving cyber battleground.</p>

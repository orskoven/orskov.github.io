# SIMON'S ‚úçÔ∏è CYBER SECURITY NOTES
___

Sure! Below is a complete Bash script to run and test all the containers you've mentioned, including Kibana, Elasticsearch, Filebeat, and `nfcapd`. The script will:

1. Pull the necessary Docker images.
2. Run the containers.
3. Check if the containers are running.
4. Test if the web services (Kibana and Elasticsearch) are accessible via the specified ports.
5. Stop the containers at the end.

Here‚Äôs the complete script:

```bash

### Explanation:

1. **Pulling Docker images**: The script pulls the required Docker images for Kibana, Elasticsearch, Filebeat, and `nfcapd`.
2. **Running containers**: Each container is started in detached mode (`-d`) and mapped to the appropriate ports.
3. **Waiting for initialization**: The script waits for 20 seconds to allow containers to initialize fully. You can adjust the wait time based on your environment.
4. **Testing the services**:

   * It checks if Kibana is accessible at `localhost:5601`.
   * It checks if Elasticsearch is accessible at `localhost:9200`.
   * It checks if `nfcapd` is accessible at port `9995`.
   * It checks if Filebeat is running (as it doesn't have a web service, just verifies it is running).
5. **Stopping and cleaning up**: After testing, the containers are stopped. Optionally, you can uncomment the line that removes the containers (`docker rm`).

### Usage:

1. **Save the script**: Copy the script into a file, e.g., `test_docker_containers.sh`.

2. **Make it executable**:

   ```bash
   chmod +x test_docker_containers.sh
   ```

3. **Run the script**:

   ```bash
   ./test_docker_containers.sh
   ```

### Notes:

* The script assumes you have Docker installed and running on your system.
* If you're running Docker on macOS/Windows through Docker Desktop, you can access the containers via `localhost` (127.0.0.1).
* Adjust the `sleep` time if the containers need more time to initialize.

Let me know if you need further customization or any other help!

### üîÑ Goal

* **Maintain NAT between Mac ‚Üî Kali Linux VM** (handled by VMware Fusion).
* **Ensure inter-container communication (ELK, Suricata, Zeek, etc.) within Kali**.
* **Avoid `network_mode: host`**, which bypasses NAT and can break communication in a virtualized NAT environment on **macOS**.

---

### ‚úÖ Key Fixes:

* Replace `network_mode: host` with **custom Docker bridge networks**.
* Explicitly **attach all containers** to the same Docker network for seamless communication.
* Set correct interfaces for packet capture (`ens34`) but ensure **interfaces are accessible from within containers**‚Äîthis may require interface pass-through or `macvlan` if host interface capture is needed.

### üîç Important Notes:

1. **Interface Name**:

   * You may need to **map `ens34` to container eth0** using `macvlan` if you require direct packet sniffing from that interface.
   * Otherwise, **pass mirrored traffic** from the host or tap into traffic using pcap with a mount.

2. **Host Interface Access** (e.g., for Suricata/Zeek):

   * On macOS with Fusion + NAT, using `host` mode is **problematic**.
   * Use **`--net=macvlan`** outside Compose if true interface access is needed.

3. **Cross-VM communication**:

   * Ensure Fusion‚Äôs NAT is properly forwarding or bridging traffic from Kali to your macOS network stack.
   * Optionally, expose `5601`, `9200`, and other ports via Fusion port forwarding.

---

Would you like me to provide a working `macvlan` example or a script to simulate mirrored traffic to `eth0` for testing Suricata and Zeek?

To run your Docker Compose setup on **Kali Linux in VMware Fusion** (or any Linux system), follow these steps:

---

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step: Run Docker Compose

#### 1. üõ† Install Docker and Docker Compose (if not already)

If you haven‚Äôt already:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

> Confirm Docker is installed:

```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

---

#### 2. üìÅ Prepare the Project Directory

Create a directory for your project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir ~/nids-elk-stack && cd ~/nids-elk-stack
```

Place the following files inside this directory:

* `docker-compose.yml` (your full setup)
* `suricata.yaml`
* `filebeat.yml`
* Any build contexts like:

  * `./nids-light/Dockerfile`
  * `./elk-siem21suricatafull/Dockerfile`

---

#### 3. üèóÔ∏è Build and Start the Stack

Run the following command to **build and launch** the services:

```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d --build
```

* `-d` runs it in the background (detached).
* `--build` ensures it rebuilds custom Docker images (`nids-light`, `elk-siem21suricatafull`).

---

#### 4. ‚úÖ Check Running Services

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see all your containers running, including `elasticsearch`, `kibana`, `suricata`, etc.

---

#### 5. üåê Access Services in Browser (from host/mac)

If you've forwarded ports correctly via **VMware NAT settings**, access:

* **Kibana**: `http://<kali-vm-ip>:5601`
* **Elasticsearch**: `http://<kali-vm-ip>:9200`

> Use `ip a` or `ifconfig` inside the Kali VM to find your NAT-assigned IP (`ens33` interface).

---

#### 6. üõë Stop the Stack

When you're done, you can shut everything down with:

```bash
sudo docker-compose down
```

---

Would you like a helper script (`start.sh`, `stop.sh`) to automate this?

# IDS (intrusion detection system(live real time)) / IPSüõ∞Ô∏è #


> IDS = passive system -> sits on the switch and duplicates/mirror ports on switch
> Cannot block traffic - but inspect the traffic
> Traffic doesnt pass through IDS / is parrallel to the traffic
> ONLY Promiscous mode / doesnt have its own ip address and sends packets through analysis tools
> Makes full packet capture + more
> 2 interfaces > monitoring and configuration
> reactive IDS'es with an attack -> it actively sets an alert -> firewalls -> built in gateways that are under attacks and lock down
> Can be dangerous to turn on and automatically lock network and possibly lock down production environemnts
> IDS cannot block current package and can reactively deploy gateway rules to block attack
> Can actively send reset packets to source IP


# IPS ( Intrusion prevention ) #

> serial connection with the network components
> 3 interfaces -> 2 for input/output  - 1 for configuration
> Should be overdimensionded to handle rules -> not firewall rules -> we have 1000 of rules for each packet passing through
> Heavy load on the network
> Looks at the packet -> look for matching rules -> can block the packet
> can also make rules for alarm


## implementation ##

> typically setup rules not to block at initial setup
> scan the traffic and undersstand the traffic of the business
> start ips as ids and then after some time turn on ips features
> often we combine ips and ids -> set of rules for logging traffic if uncertain -> and be sure to block only certain attack
> IDS can helo verify IPS is still operational and error detect ips
> IDS can alert the ips (since ips is further down the network chain)
> We can place a NIDS (network intrusion detection) on the trusted network subnet for detection of attacks from hosts on the edge of the network
> Limit IDS to the most important segments


## TYPES of IDS / IPS ##

## TYPES of IDS / IPS ##

| Type               | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Network-based**  | Network sensors scan traffic that is designated to many hosts               |
| **Host-based**     | Host agent monitors all operations within an operating system               |
| **Signature-based**| Monitors for specific patterns (signatures) that match known threats        |
| **Anomaly-based**  | Flags behavior that deviates from established normal usage patterns         |
| **Hybrid-based**   | Combines multiple detection methods for more accurate threat detection      |


## NETWORK-BASED and Host-Based IPS ##

# üõ°Ô∏è NETWORK-BASED vs. HOST-BASED IPS

Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are critical tools in cybersecurity. They actively monitor and analyze traffic to detect and prevent malicious activity in real-time.

---

## üåê Network-Based IPS (NIPS)

> **Monitors traffic across the entire network.**

### üîç Characteristics:
- Deployed at strategic points (e.g., gateway, firewall).
- Inspects **network packets**.
- Can block **DoS/DDoS** attacks and scanning.
- **Cannot decrypt encrypted payloads** (e.g., TLS, symmetric encryption).

### üß† Example Detection:
- Port scans
- SYN floods
- Known exploit signatures

### ‚ùå Limitation:
```diff
- Cannot see inside encrypted traffic
- Cannot detect host-level malware
````

### üìä ASCII Diagram:

```
[Internet] ---> [NIPS Firewall] ---> [Internal Network]
                   ||      
            Scans packets 
         Detects network threats
```

---

## üíª Host-Based IPS (HIPS)

> **Installed directly on endpoint hosts (e.g., servers, laptops).**

### üîç Characteristics:

* Analyzes **system-level activity** (files, processes, registry).
* Can **detect encrypted malware** (e.g., ransomware).
* Monitors behavior at **kernel-level**.

### üß† Example Detection:

* Code injection (DLL)
* Registry manipulation
* Privilege escalation

### üîê Advantage:

```diff
+ Can decrypt and analyze local encrypted activity
+ Detects polymorphic and obfuscated malware
```

### üìä ASCII Diagram:

```
[Host System]
     |
[ HIPS Agent ]

Detects ransomware, privilege abuse
```

## ‚öîÔ∏è NIPS vs HIPS ‚Äî Key Differences

| Feature              | NIPS üåê                   | HIPS üíª                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Deployment Location  | Network perimeter         | Individual host machines           |
| Visibility           | Network traffic           | Host activity                      |
| Encryption Awareness | ‚ùå Cannot decrypt payloads | ‚úÖ Can analyze decrypted data       |
| Attack Focus         | DDoS, worms, scans        | Malware, exploits, privilege abuse |
| Performance Overhead | Low (network-wide)        | Higher (host CPU/memory)           |

---

## üéØ Summary:

> üõ°Ô∏è **Use both NIPS and HIPS for a layered defense strategy**.

* NIPS provides **broad visibility** and **traffic control**.
* HIPS provides **deep visibility** and **system-level detection**.
* Together, they cover both **external threats** and **internal exploits**.

---

## üß© Cybersecurity Expert Insight

* üîê **Encrypted traffic (SSL/TLS, symmetric keys)** bypasses NIPS.
* üß¨ **HIPS can catch payloads once decrypted on host memory**.
* üé≠ Malware authors use **encryption + polymorphism** to evade NIPS.

> üí° Best Practice: Use **SSL decryption** + **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)** in combination with HIPS/NIPS.

___

> NIPS can better detect broad attacks on the network ( DDOS )
> HIPS detect specific host based attacks ( cryptology in malware
> NIPS cannot detect symmmetric key encryption and not decrypt -> NIPS cannot see payload and will not detect BUT host can detectypt on the host

# üîç ADVANCED FEATURES OF IDS/IPS SYSTEMS

## üöß Resource Constraints in NIPS

> NIPS are often bundled into unified security appliances (e.g., Checkpoint, Fortinet).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Real-World Constraint:
- Limited CPU/Memory on router+NIPS combo boxes
- Cannot handle high-throughput environments easily
- Performance degrades with **deep packet inspection (DPI)**

---

## üß¨ Signature-Based Detection (IDS/IPS)

> Pattern recognition using known malware fingerprints.

### üìå How It Works:
- Match traffic or file hash against known **MD5/SHA signatures**
- Example: `e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03` ‚Üí matches known malware

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Evasion Techniques:
```diff
- Add a space, modify a byte, re-encode ‚Üí signature breaks
````

#### üóÇÔ∏è Example Rule:

```plaintext
Alert if "/etc/shadow" is accessed ‚Üí trigger signature match
```

---

## üßæ Policy-Based Detection

> Predefined rules based on organizational policy

### üß± Example Use Case:

* ‚ùå Sales department trying to access Tech segment
* ‚ùå FTP traffic over HTTP port
* ‚úÖ Trigger alert if segmentation is violated

---

## üìà Anomaly-Based Detection

> Define "normal," detect the abnormal

### üß™ Process:

1. Establish a **baseline** (normal traffic patterns)
2. Detect deviation:

   * ‚ùå Excessive UDP from one host
   * ‚ùå DHCP-like traffic on non-standard port
   * ‚ùå ICMP packet with abnormal payload size/content

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges:

* Defining "normal" is **hard**
* Networks are **dynamic**
* High **false positive rate**

---

## üåê SYN Flood Example (Anomaly Detection)

* TCP SYN packets flood a target without ACKs
* Sudden spike in half-open connections
* IDS tracks TCP state and alerts on abnormal patterns

---

## üìä OSI LAYER VISUALIZATION FOR IDS/IPS

```plaintext
+--------------------------+
| Layer 7: Application     | <-- IDS inspects HTTP, FTP, DNS
+--------------------------+
| Layer 6: Presentation    | <-- Limited inspection (e.g., TLS)
+--------------------------+
| Layer 5: Session         | <-- Track stateful sessions
+--------------------------+
| Layer 4: Transport       | <-- Detects SYN floods, port scans
+--------------------------+
| Layer 3: Network         | <-- Inspects IP headers
+--------------------------+
| Layer 2: Data Link       | <-- Rare, but MAC-based filtering
+--------------------------+
| Layer 1: Physical        | ‚ùå Not inspected by IDS
+--------------------------+
```

| Behavior Learning (Baseline) | ‚ùå                       | ‚úÖ                   | ‚úÖ                           |
| Encryption Awareness         | ‚ùå unless SSL inspection | ‚ùå unless on host    | ‚ùå unless decrypted upstream |

---

## üß† Final Insight:

> **Combining NIPS, HIPS, firewalls, and behavioral analytics = true layered security.**

* Signature-based is **fast but blind to variants**
* Anomaly-based is **powerful but noisy**
* Policy-based ensures **compliance enforcement**
* Each system has **different visibility & control scope**

---

# üõ°Ô∏è Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and IDS/IPS Application Layer Mastery

## üîç Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)

> DPI is the ability to inspect not only headers but also the **actual contents (payload)** of packets.

‚úÖ **Main Difference from Firewalls**:
- Firewalls generally operate up to **Layer 4 (Transport Layer)**.
- IDS/IPS can inspect **Layer 7 (Application Layer)** ‚Üí HTTP, DNS, FTP, SMTP, etc.

### üì¶ IDS/IPS Enables:
- Malware detection inside HTTP traffic
- SQL injection payloads
- DNS tunneling detection
- Protocol misuse (e.g., SSH over port 80)

## ‚öîÔ∏è IPS Action Order

> Typical order of operations for an Intrusion Prevention System:

| Action   | Description                                                                 |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pass`   | Allow the traffic through                                                   |
| `drop`   | Silently discard the traffic                                                |
| `reject` | Drop the packet and optionally send TCP RST/ICMP unreachable                |
| `alert`  | Log and notify, **standard for IDS** (does not block traffic)              |

üß† IDS typically uses:
```plaintext
pass ‚Üí alert
````

üõ°Ô∏è IPS typically uses:

```plaintext
pass ‚Üí alert ‚Üí drop ‚Üí reject
```

# üîê **Suricata + ELK Stack Integration: Full Packet Capture (FPC) & NIDS Monitoring**

**Audience**: SOC Analysts, Security Engineers, Network Architects  
**Reviewed by**: Cybersecurity Engineering Team  
**Last Updated**: 2025-05-06  

## üîç **Objective:**

This guide covers the integration of **Suricata** for **Full Packet Capture (FPC)**, with **Filebeat** as a log shipper, sending network intrusion detection data to an **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** for advanced threat analysis, rule monitoring, and visualization.

### Key Components:
1. **Suricata (NIDS)** - For network intrusion detection and Full Packet Capture (FPC).
2. **Filebeat** - Lightweight shipper that forwards Suricata alerts to ELK.
3. **ELK Stack** - Elasticsearch for storing and querying logs, Logstash for processing logs, and Kibana for visualizing alerts and traffic.
4. **NIDS Light** - Lightweight sensor for generating rules and monitoring intrusion detection data.

---

## üß© **Architecture Overview**



### **Workflow:**

1. **Suricata** monitors network traffic, detects intrusions, and performs Full Packet Capture.
2. **Suricata EVE JSON output** (alerts) is forwarded by **Filebeat** to **Logstash** for processing.
3. **Logstash** parses, enriches, and sends logs to **Elasticsearch**.
4. **Kibana** is used to visualize the network traffic, detected intrusions, and the health of the network.

---

## üì¶ **Installing Tools and Configuring the Stack**

### 1. **Install Suricata (NIDS)**

Suricata will perform **Full Packet Capture** and generate alerts based on network traffic analysis.

```bash
# Install Suricata on your system (example: Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install suricata
```

**Configuration**:

* Ensure that Suricata is configured to output alerts in **EVE JSON format** (ideal for Filebeat forwarding).

Edit `suricata.yaml` to enable EVE JSON logging:

```yaml
outputs:
  - eve-log:
      enabled: yes
      filetype: json
      filename: /var/log/suricata/eve.json
```

### 2. **Install Filebeat (Log Shipper)**

Filebeat is used to ship logs from Suricata to the ELK stack.

```bash
# Install Filebeat (example: Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install filebeat
```

**Configuration**:
Edit `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml` to enable Suricata EVE JSON input:

```yaml
filebeat.inputs:
  - type: log
    enabled: true
    paths:
      - /var/log/suricata/eve.json
    json.keys_under_root: true
    json.add_error_key: true
```

Configure the output to send logs to **Logstash** (which will forward logs to Elasticsearch):

```yaml
output.logstash:
  hosts: ["localhost:5044"]
```

### 3. **Install Logstash (Log Processor)**

Logstash will receive and process Suricata's alerts and forward them to Elasticsearch.

```bash
# Install Logstash (example: Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install logstash
```

**Configuration**:
Create a pipeline to parse the Suricata alerts. In `/etc/logstash/conf.d/suricata-pipeline.conf`, configure the filter and output settings:

```bash
input {
  beats {
    port => 5044
  }
}

filter {
  if [fileset][module] == "suricata" {
    # Suricata-specific filter to decode EVE JSON format
    json {
      source => "message"
      target => "suricata"
    }
  }
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["http://localhost:9200"]
    index => "suricata-alerts-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
  }
}
```

### 4. **Install Elasticsearch**

Elasticsearch stores and indexes the processed logs from Suricata.

```bash
# Install Elasticsearch (example: Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install elasticsearch
```

**Start Elasticsearch**:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch
```

### 5. **Install Kibana (Visualization)**

Kibana provides a user-friendly interface to visualize Suricata alerts, monitor traffic, and create dashboards.

```bash
# Install Kibana (example: Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install kibana
```

**Start Kibana**:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable kibana
sudo systemctl start kibana
```
___
Absolutely. Below is a **top professional chapter** written in **Markdown with UX/UI best practices** for inclusion in a **high-end cybersecurity practitioner‚Äôs handbook or online reference book**. It focuses on **NIDS Light, Suricata rule writing, testing, and alert generation**, based on your detailed content.

---

# üìñ Chapter 7: NIDS Light & Suricata Rule Crafting Best Practices

**Audience**: Cybersecurity Practitioners, SOC Engineers, Red/Blue Team Operators  
**Scope**: NIDS operation, rule development, alert interpretation, and traffic simulation  
**Stack Focus**: Suricata, Emerging Threats Rules, Fast Logging, Full Packet Capture  
**Prerequisites**: Linux CLI proficiency, packet analysis fundamentals, IDS/IPS concepts  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 1. Verifying Suricata (NIDS Light) Service Status

To confirm if Suricata is operational:

```bash
sudo service suricata status
````

Expected output (example):

```
‚óè suricata.service - LSB: Next generation IDS/IPS
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/suricata)
   Active: active (running)
```

If inactive, start the service:

```bash
sudo service suricata start
```

---

## üåê 2. Rule Management & Emerging Threats (ET) Sources

Suricata supports two major **open rule feed sources**:

| Rule Set | Type       | Update Frequency  | Access Type       |
| -------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| ET Open  | Community  | Delayed (30 days) | Free              |
| ET Pro   | Commercial | Real-time         | Paid Subscription |

Auto-updating can be configured using **`suricata-update`**:

```bash
sudo suricata-update
```

> üîÅ This ensures the latest rules are fetched from your configured provider (ET Open by default).

Rule files are stored in:

```bash
/var/lib/suricata/rules/
```

Custom rules are usually placed in:

```bash
/etc/suricata/rules/local.rules
```

---

## üßæ 3. Anatomy of a Suricata / Snort Rule

```snort
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: "TCP packet detected"; sid:5000001;)
```

### üîç Rule Breakdown:

| Element        | Meaning                                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `alert`        | Action: alert, log, drop, reject                     |
| `tcp`          | Protocol                                             |
| `any any`      | Source IP and source port                            |
| `->`           | Direction of traffic                                 |
| `any any`      | Destination IP and port                              |
| `(msg: "...")` | Message shown in alert logs                          |
| `sid:5000001;` | Unique Signature ID (must not conflict with others!) |

---

## üé® 4. Visual Rule Breakdown Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[alert] --> B[tcp]
    B --> C[any (src IP)]
    C --> D[any (src port)]
    D --> E[-> direction]
    E --> F[any (dest IP)]
    F --> G[any (dest port)]
    G --> H[msg: "TCP packet detected"]
    H --> I[sid: 5000001]
```

### üìå Best Practices:

* Use `sid` > **7000000** for custom rules to avoid collisions
* Comment unused rules with `#` to avoid performance impact
* Place custom rules in `local.rules`
* Keep your rules **short, specific**, and **context-aware**

---

## üè† 5. Preconfigured Variables

Suricata supports **variables** to simplify and modularize rule definitions.

```snort
var HOME_NET [10.0.0.0/8]
var HTTP_PORTS [80,8080,443]
var EXTERNAL_NET !$HOME_NET
```

You can use variables in rules like this:

```snort
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET $HTTP_PORTS (msg:"HTTP attempt"; sid:7000001;)
```

---

## üß™ 6. Testing & Enabling Custom Rules

### üî¨ Step 1: Test Rule Syntax

```bash
sudo suricata -T -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -v
```

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Enable Rule

Restart Suricata to apply the new rule:

```bash
sudo service suricata restart
```

---

## üìÅ 7. Alerts & Full Packet Capture

### üîî Alert Log File

```bash
/var/log/suricata/fast.log
```

### üßµ To search for a specific alert:

```bash
grep 5000001 /var/log/suricata/fast.log
```

### üíΩ Full Packet Capture (.pcap)

Suricata automatically captures packet data in:

```bash
/var/log/suricata/*.pcap
```

Ensure the system is on a **NAT or bridge** mode interface to capture the correct traffic (e.g., `eth0`, `ens33`, `enp0s3`).

---

## üéá 8. Simulate Traffic (Generate Noise)

Download known malicious traffic to simulate real-world alerts:

1. üì¶ Download Sample PCAP:

```bash
wget https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2023/10/31/2023-10-31-icedID-traffic.pcap.zip
unzip 2023-10-31-icedID-traffic.pcap.zip
```

2. üõ†Ô∏è Replay with `tcpreplay`:

```bash
sudo tcpreplay -i eth0 -M10 2023-10-31-icedID-infection-traffic.pcap
```

> üì¢ This sends the packet stream to the interface, generating alerts that Suricata will log and potentially match rules for.

---

## üö¶ 9. Common Pitfalls

| Mistake                         | Solution                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sid` collision                 | Use unique SID values > 7000000                                         |
| Rules not firing                | Check direction, port, and protocol accuracy                            |
| Interface not capturing traffic | Ensure NIC is in **promiscuous** mode (`ip link set eth0 promisc on`)   |
| Overloaded system               | Disable unused rules (`# comment`) or apply rule thresholds             |
| IDS not seeing ARP              | IDS systems typically don‚Äôt parse L2 ARP packets ‚Äì consider switch logs |

---

## üîö Summary

| Action                    | Tool / Command                         |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Check Suricata is running | `sudo service suricata status`         |
| Update community rules    | `sudo suricata-update`                 |

## ‚öôÔ∏è **NIDS Light ‚Äì Lightweight Sensor for Rule Generation**

NIDS Light is an intrusion detection sensor that helps generate rules and monitor traffic in a lightweight manner. It integrates with Suricata for rule-based alerts.

**Installation**:

* NIDS Light can be installed on the same server as Suricata or on a separate monitoring node.
* Rules are created based on **traffic patterns**, and suspicious events are logged for analysis.

---

## üìä **Using Kibana to Visualize Suricata Alerts**

Once Suricata is running and Filebeat is shipping the logs, you can use Kibana to visualize the alerts.

1. **Access Kibana** via the browser:

   ```plaintext
   http://localhost:5601
   ```

2. **Set up Index Patterns** in Kibana:

   * Go to **Management > Index Patterns**.
   * Create an index pattern `suricata-alerts-*`.

3. **Create Dashboards**:

   * Go to **Dashboard > Create New Dashboard**.
   * Add visualizations (such as **pie charts**, **bar graphs**, and **time series** data) to analyze Suricata alerts, network traffic anomalies, and intrusion detection statistics.

---

## üîê **Security Monitoring with ELK SIEM**

Elasticsearch with Kibana provides powerful features for **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**:

* **Alerting**: Set up thresholds to trigger alerts for certain types of traffic, intrusions, or anomalies.
* **Anomaly Detection**: Use machine learning-based detection models to automatically identify suspicious patterns in network traffic.

> üß† **Note**: **SIEM** will leverage both **Suricata's logs** and **NIDS Light alerts** for a comprehensive threat detection and monitoring system.

---

## üöÄ **Conclusion**

By combining **Suricata** for **Full Packet Capture (FPC)**, **Filebeat** for log shipping, and **ELK Stack** for storage, analysis, and visualization, you create a **robust and scalable NIDS/IDS solution**.

> ‚úÖ **Monitoring**: With this setup, you can continuously monitor network traffic for anomalies, intrusions, and other suspicious activities.
> ‚úÖ **Alerting & SIEM**: Using Elasticsearch and Kibana, you can efficiently process, store, and visualize security events in real-time.

With **NIDS Light**, you also gain **lightweight rule generation** capabilities to adapt to new threats without significant overhead.

> ‚ú® **Next Steps**:
>

## Exercise 12.b ‚Äì Tripwire

### Install Tripwire

```bash
sudo apt-get install tripwire
```

### Initialize configuration

Set the passphrase when prompted.

### Edit `/etc/tripwire/twpol.txt` to define protected directories

Example:

```bash
(
  rulename = "System binaries",
  severity = 100
)
{
  /bin -> $(SEC_CRIT);
  /sbin -> $(SEC_CRIT);
  /etc -> $(SEC_CRIT);
}
```

### Create site and local keys

```bash
sudo twadmin --generate-keys
```

### Initialize the Tripwire database

```bash
sudo tripwire --init
```

### Test Tripwire

1. Create a new file in `/bin`:

   ```bash
   sudo touch /bin/evil
   ```

2. Run Tripwire check:

   ```bash
   sudo tripwire --check
   ```

### Schedule Tripwire in crontab

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

Add:

```cron
*/20 * * * * /usr/sbin/tripwire --check
```

  TCP_PORTS="1,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,20,21,22,23,25,37,42,43,53,69,79,80,110,111"
  UDP_PORTS="1,7,9,69,161,162"
  ```

* **Add fake ports to monitor non-existing ones.**

* **Uncomment iptables integration to block scans:**

  ```txt
  KILL_ROUTE="/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -s $TARGET$ -j DROP"
  ```

### Run PortSentry and test with Nmap from another machine

```bash
sudo systemctl restart portsentry
```

Example Nmap command from another machine:

```bash
nmap -sS <target-IP>

```txt
# ZONE   TYPE
fw       firewall
net      ipv4
dmz      ipv4
loc      ipv4
```

### Define interfaces in `interfaces`:

```txt
#ZONE  INTERFACE  BROADCAST
net    eth0       detect
dmz    eth1       detect
loc    eth2       detect
```

### Setup routing rules in `policy`:

```txt
#SOURCE  DEST    POLICY
loc      net     ACCEPT
loc      dmz     ACCEPT
dmz      loc     DROP
net      dmz     ACCEPT
net      loc     DROP
```

Firwalls implemented on each host system via iptables are a very cost effective way to control and filter out unwanted traffic.

Not only implementing packet filtering mechanism in a network architecture through Firewalls implemented on the communication lines, but also on each host machine system will allow for more secure means of communication.

This also adheares to principle of [defence in depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing)). [Military  Defenc in depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_in_depth)

## Chains ##

Set a chain with a purpose: 
We can insert subchains in the iptables main 3 chains  INPUT, FORWARD, OUTPUT.



___

Server with economic system and database (seperated). 
Can protect databases from remote access.
Granular access

___

Ensure to boot with execute IP rules for saving rules with shutdown and apply rules when boot.

USE VERBOSE 
```bash
sudo iptables -L -v
```

> alice@alice: /etc/netplan$
```bash
sudo iptables -S
```
>-P INPUT ACCEPT
>-P FORWARD ACCEPT
>-P OUTPUT ACCEPT


```bash
sudo iptables -L
```
>Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)       target     prot opt source               destination         Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)  target     prot opt source               destination Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT) target     prot opt source               destination 
___

Append rule at the end of chain:
```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
```

| -m = module (can help about what happend prior to packet (n) | conntrack (list of standard services that uses more than one port)  (stateful inspection) | -- ctstate | ESTABLISHED,RELATED (BASED ON 3-way handshake) Packets not established from inside are dropped, i allow responses from the established connection from internal host RELATED = if protocol uses more n>1 more than 1 protocols for the service¬†| j =¬†jump | ACCEPT / DROP|

Allow anywhere tcp 
```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p TCP --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
```
Allow only specific ip address:
```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p TCP --dport 22 --source 192.168.249.1/24 -j ACCEPT
```
Delete chain rule 2
```bash
sudo iptables -D INPUT 2
```

For redundany:
LOOPBACK important for services performance (most packets must be first in the chain for performance tuning)
```bash
sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -i lo -j ACCEPT
```

## Authentication ## 

Password [HIVE: Brute Force table risk](https://www.hivesystems.com/blog/are-your-passwords-in-the-green)

Read NIST's view on [authenticators](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3-Implementation-Resources/63B/Authenticators/) 

Shared secret ( we know something mutaual) 

Imaging a battlefield -> if soldiers have to pass they should know the mutual shared secret to not be shot down if approcing friendly lines back from scouting. 

In todays digital world this is a bit problematic. 

Why is this not suitable:

- this is something we know and this is easy to steal or guess

Other options? 

- something we have is better

Back in the days, we could rip off a dollar ticket and the two pieces will onyl match and this can verify and authenticate.

We categories this as another methode of verification:
- This is more unique and authenticate
- But will be more costly to implement than a password (or something we know)


Biometric authentication: 
- This is another methode of verification


## [Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication) depends on the weakes link ## 


3 methodes:
        - What you know (passwords)
        - What you have(dongle, smartcard, certficate, phone,...)
        - What you are(biometrics, height, voice, walk dynamics,...)


Danish solution *NemID* (outfaced)
An authentication methode implemented often via keys on a physical card with 50 keys.
        - Implementation : you get a number and must find the correspending key on the physical card. 
üî∫RISKS : 
        - People take pictures of the physical card and coudl share it.
        
Other solutions to keys:
        - With a dongle 


CURRENT danish authentication:
        - app on phone

## Weakness of passwords ##

**Password reuse**
**Writing down passwords**
**Weak system in password creation** 

For fun only:
[Statistics on passwords](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/password-stats)
___

## Educate users when setting up passwords  ##

- Tell the user if it is to easy to implement the password
- Check and compare reuse of passwords from databases

___

Middleware Software also default passwords
- Databases ( MySQL, LDAP, MS, Oracle,...) Web servers, Web shop templates.
- CRM, economic system

## PROCEDURE Checklist: 

- Check password
- Delete original admin account
- document admin account credentials (for all systems all devices)
- ask people for passwords (what are your passwords)
- research passwords on social media ( Men chooses : hobbies, football clubs | Women : Chooses emotional topics, family names, interests)
- try online guessing
- hashes brute forcing / download hashes and bruteforce passwords
- Do not store passwords in clear text
- use ***[key derevative](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Projects/crypto-publication-review-project/documents/initial-comments/sp800-132-initial-public-comments-2023.pdf)*** hashing functions like Argon2 also look at my [explenation of hashing](https://orskoven.github.io/orskov.github.io/#use-key-derivative-functions-for-password-storage)
- use salt and peber ( user database is salt and password (then you save peber someware else))  

___


```bash
nmap
```
Look for gateway (look for dhcp) 
```bash
PORTS  STATE  SERVICE REASON  
22/tcp  open   ssh     syn-ack
                dhcp
```
Enter the following ip address in browser
```bash
192.168.0.1 
```
Then search for deault password on the web to pass login page. 

___

### Practical password ###

üñ•Ô∏è on linux let's look at the password hashing storing in linux ubuntu system.
Hashes and plaintext are stored seperately for permission granularity. 

```bash
john:$y$salt$hash
```
| $ |¬†Seperator |¬†
| salt |¬†before hash value / makes rainbowtable useless (will cost the attacker on CPU or and TIME) |¬†

```bash
cat /etc/passwd
```
```bash
cat /etc/shadow
```
___



Accessing the data maliciosly 

**Remeber to encrypt disk** 

Scenario : 
> BOOT with your own disk inserted to a host (extenal usb)
> The system should open with permission for the usb inserted.  
> Next: the attack should overwrite the /etc/passwd file

This would occur to user:
> if password is not corretly written in login
> user will be prompted and cause is the attacker in scenario before

___

### GUIDE : ###
üî∫ Only with physical access and non encrypted disk üî∫ 

Booting with permission and priviliges to external usb inserted

Imagine BOB (current admin)  ALICE(hacker)


```bash
sudo adduser alice
```
```bash
password123
```
Enter Information 
and access hashed password file:
```bash
sudo cat /etc/shadow 
```
in editing mode in the file 
swap two password hashes
(for learning: you should know both passwords) 
now with the hash swap you can login in with the other users password.

Whitebox test.

___

### Password Defence ### 

Strong password policyüî∫
- opensource compiled manager - research / sandbox / compile yourself
- require longer passwords
- require uppercase lowercase numbers special characters
- limit password validity 60 or 90 days
- consuder system generated passwords
- use some password manager
- periodic cracking of company users passwords for "simple passwords"
- no reuse of userid & password across service
- add location and time limitations for login
- add second or third factor of authentication
  > combine with out of band info, one-time pw, tokens

### The Stack ###

ELK stack 

### Elasticsearch ###

Ensure to link data and correlate data.
No need for data preparation manually. 

### Kibana ###
UI for graphical presentation of the data.

### Beats ### 
Ingest from different systems. 
We can install beats on hosts to pick up and sensor logs from multiple hosts into the ELK stack.

Logstash 
Kibana
Beats 
and others 

Centralized logs 

Helps centralize between example: 

Web servers - Admin servers - Redundant databases - Application Servers

Major outages avoid, since elastic stack is centralized logs. 

Kibana is visualisation of the logs.

Can search logs for it security issues. 

Not like Splunk. 

Core components opensource and free

end point security monitoring self host stack


### BEATS ###

Light weight way to ship logs into the stack
written in go:

Filebeat 
Packetbeat 
+ more

Logstash transform incoming data.
Beats single purpose tool. 

Logstash is more resource intensive.


Elasticsearch 

holds index of data 
holds all data itself

in production is deployed in a cluster 
with shards a b c 
redundant copies in clusters like kubernetes 


### KIBANA ### 

Web frontend, define preset dashboard for birdseye view. 


### Setup ###

VM 
Vagrant

## Arp Spoofing ##

Installing arpspoof for linux.
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install dsniff
```
> Make linux act as a "router" (man in the middle).
Remove '#' commented line with the text: ‚Äúnet.ipv4.ip_forward = 1‚Äù.
/etc/sysctl.conf
```bash
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
```
Reconfigure the kernel parameters at runtime to apply the change.
```bash
sudo sysctl -p
```

On victim ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt install net-tools
```
Check arp table. 
```bash
sudo arp -a
```

üîªOn both attacker and victim terminals.

üî∫ Adjust ip addresses acordingly: 

> in my setup: Attacker IP: 172.16.196.132 | Victim IP: 172.16.196.133
> 
```bash
sudo arpspoof -i eth0 -t 172.16.196.133 172.16.196.132
```
```bash
sudo arpspoof -i eth0 -t 172.16.196.132 172.16.196.133
```

Check the ARP table again to verify that the victim ip address has been removed when arp spoofing.
```bash
sudo arp -a
```

> In my case it all i one terminal so i will use '&' to allow multiple commands running simulatniously:

```bash
sudo arpspoof -i eth0 -t 172.16.196.132 172.16.196.133 & sudo arpspoof -i eth0 -t 172.16.196.133 172.16.196.132 & sudo arp -a

## üï∏Ô∏èVirutal Private Networking (VPN)üï∏Ô∏è ## 

Devices are typically protected on a local network, because of local ip address space not being defualt routable across the internet.

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) can be setup to securely connect and access resources on a reomte local ip address space and make resources securely availbale through network tunneling protocols, not requiring connected hosts to be on the same local ip network.

Encryption is vital to the security of the VPN when the VPN is accessed through insecure communication lines (the public internet).

Provider-provisioned VPN is isolating the provider's own network infrastruture in virtual segments. 
This allows for making segements private to other segements in the network. 
This can be implemented with weak or no security feautures 

[VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network)
Sources for the following content origins from Scott Simpsons course on linkedin learning [Learning VPN](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-vpn/how-vpn-works?resume=false&u=36836804)
___

### Routing ###

Routes determines how packets flow to different networks.
A **Layer 3 VPN** creates a new route for a virtual network adapter

### Bridging ###

**Layer 2** VPNs behave like devices that are on the same physical network.

### Encapsulation ###

Information is wrapped inside of packets that can travel between networks.
Local traffic is encapsulated to travel between client and server.

___

## Layer 2 (data link layer)üíå ##

Transmission of frames between devices
Bridged VPN 
Layer 2 virtual devices are called TAP (tap0,tap1) 


## Layer 3 (network layer)üõ§Ô∏è ##

Transmission of packets (IP)
Routed VPN
Layer 3 virutal devices are called TUN (tun0, tun1)

## PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) (Layer 2) ##

Sets up a connection between two hosts 
Creates a connection between two hosts with a virtual network adapter at each end
ISP used to crete a network link over media-like phones lines to carry ehternet frames between IP networks
Used in DSL Modems and most VPN protocols

## Key ExchangeüóùÔ∏è<->üóùÔ∏è ##

VPN peers exchange encryption information to establish a secure connection.

Some protocols rely on a PSK (pre-shared key) and others agree on what security keys to use when a connection is started. 

Negotiate back and forth to agress on a key exchange before setting up a secure channel.


## Forward Securityüîê ##

Also called "Perfect Forward Security".

New session keys are generated for each session used to encrypt and decrypt the data.

Prevents malicious reuse of keys for future sessions. (Go to the hybrid encryption section)

üî∫ RISK : be sure to use secure and not broken protocols üî∫

## Portsüõ≥Ô∏è ##

Ports used by VPN protocls are the ports on the server.

Clients choose a local port to connect from.

Ports need to be opened on the server's firewall and on the any firewalls between it and the internet. 

___

## üî∫PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocolüî∫ ###

üî∫ Considered obsolete because most of the ciphers it uses are easily brokenüî∫

üî∫Top out on 128 bit encryptionüî∫

üî∫Uses **TCP port 1723** to set up a **GRE tunnel**, through which a PPP connection **(Protocol 47)** transfers encrypted packets.üî∫

üî∫Most routers pass PPTP traffic without a problem. üî∫

___

## L2TP/IPsec ##

Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol over IPsec (IP security)

IPsec creates a secure channel through which an L2TP tunnel transfers data.

# [L2TP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_2_Tunneling_Protocol) #
Encapsulates Layer 2 traffic to travel over Layer 3 (IP) (normally not possible)
Allows Ethernet Bridging over the internet
No security

# [IPsec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec) #
Creates a secure connection
Only carries IP traffic

## Making an [L2TP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_2_Tunneling_Protocol)/[IPsec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec) Connection ##

IPsec uses IKE (Internet Key Exchange) via UDP port 500 to negotiate a Security Association (SA) 

UDP port 4500 for NAT traversal mode

SA sets up ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload; protocol 50) to encrypt packets.

L2TP tunnel is established through TCP port 1701, to pass traffic protected with ESP

PPP establishes virtual network interface with IP addresses at each end.

üë±‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Uses user authentication and machine-level shared secret or certificate
may need group name based on system admin setup.

‚úîÔ∏è Good choice for security and is widely available

Useful if you need to transfer Layer 2 data instead of just Layer 3 data.

# IKEv2 #
Internet Key Exchange, version 2

IKEv2 manages the SA for an IPsec connection

Uses UDP port 500 and UDP port 4500 for NAT traversal (supports 256 bit encryption) 

IPsec provides Layer 3 connectivity (IP)

üí≤MOBIKE feature provides quick reconnection - great for mobile devicesüì¥üí≤

Uses user authentication, shared secret or certificate and a remote ID

___

## [OpenVPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVPN) ##

Open-source software and protocol.

Uses OpenSSL library to handle key exchange via **SSL/TLS** (offers 256 bit encryption) 

Creates a Layer 2 or Layer 3 connection. 

Via custom security protocol based on TLS. 

Uses TCP port 1194 by default, can be changed to other UDP/TCP ports. 

Works well through NAT and proxies.

‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è Widely recommended


___
### Other Protocols ###

## [Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Socket_Tunneling_Protocol) ##

Creates a secure channel using **SSL/TLS**

Uses **TCP port 443**

Fairly wide support 

Creates a client-network connection

## [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com) ##

Software and protocol (offers high security) 

Out-of-band key exchange (keys are assigned to peers in configuration)

Creates Layer 2 and Layer 3 connections over IP

Packets are encrypted with the public key of the destination host

Open source, with a goal of easy auditability

Not considered finalized (yet) [WireGuard.com](https://www.wireguard.com)

## [SoftEther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoftEther_VPN) ##

Software Ethernet

Offers IPsec, SSTP, and other protocols, in addition to its own protocol

Sends traffic through HTTPS

Offers Layer 2 and Layer 3 connections

Creates virtualized Ethernet devices

Open source [softether.com](https://www.softether.org)


___

## [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) FORWARDING ##

Secure Shell 

Create a connection to an SSH server for port forwarding

Uses TCP port 22 but can use other ports 

Can forward a local port to a remote port (connect localhost:8080 to server:80)

Some implementations can open a local port and act as a SOCKS proxy sending traffic to the server


SSH doesnt create network interfaces 

Very useful for certain cases 

Widespored and difficult to block


___

## üö¶TRANSFERING A FILE SECURELY WITH SCP AND SFTPüóÉÔ∏èüîêüö¶ ##

Transferring files should be confidentially encrypted to secure zero tampering while in transit.
FTP <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">[File Transfer Protoco]</a>  was not concieved with proper encryption, hence SFTP is prefered.

In this guide i propose two different commandline linux solutions for encrypted file transfer, SFTP (recommended) and SCP (outdated / not-recommended). 

We are using scp even if it is outdated, for learning purposes.
___
### TOOLS USED ###

[i run two seperate hosts on vmware (community/free) locally]
 
**[IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) addresses (IP addresses)** of the two machinesüñ•Ô∏è running linux (preferrable ubuntu servers).

You can find the ip address with ```ifconfig``` look at eth0 and inet.

or 

use ```ip a``` and look for inet.
Basic knowledge of bash command line scripting and perhaps (networking).
___
#### !NETWORK SETUP! ####

On both hosts add a user1 or use another user to send recieve files.

Create a user named "user1"
```bash
adduser user1
```
switch user to "user1"
```bash
su - user1
```
___
### CODE IMPLEMENTATION ###


#### FILE TRASNFER USING SCP(outdated) ####

ON SENDING HOST
```cd``` into the /home/user1 directory
create a file using ```nano``` 
```bash
cd /home/user1
 ```
create a file using ```nano``` 
```bash
nano file.txt
 ```
add some txt
```txt
hello world
```

(not-recommended) use scp to transfer the file.txt
```bash
scp file.txt user1@<ip address>:/home/user1
```
[in my local setup] i use ipv4 address: ```172.16.196.134``` for the recieving server
```bash
scp file.txt user1@$172.16.196.134:/home/user1
```

#### Verify the result on the recieving server ####

ON RECIEVING HOST

```bash
su - user1
```
```bash
cd /home/user1/
```
check if the file.txt appears
```bash
ls 
```
```bash
nano file.txt
```

If the text matches ```hello world```, congratulations you are done‚úîÔ∏è.

AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM | CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT | SINGLE SIGN ON (SSO)

Preventing potential threat actors from sniffing any enterprise confidential information can be handle with Kerberos, while maintaining high availability to critical to employee resources.

**[Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/)**  a network authentication protocol [Free], offers usability through it's Ticket Granting System/Ticket based authentication. It uses [symmetric-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol)) and requires a trusted third party and optionally may use public-key cryptography during certain phases of communication.

Uses UDP port 88 as default.


### Kerberos from the inside

 Use Case: End user wishes to gain access to a service supporting Kerberos (Kerberized Service).

 1. End Userüñ•Ô∏è uses **Kerberos client** on their system with *username* & *password*
 2. **Kerberos client** creates *authentication request* in clear text to **authentication server**
 3. **Authentication server** looks up *user* in its *database* and retrieves user's *password*
 4. **Authentication server** sends two messages back to client:
    1. **TGS session key** randomly generated session key for **Kerberos Client** and **Ticket Granting Server** [Message is encrypted using the clients *password*].
    2. **Ticket Granting Ticket** includes information about the **Kerberos Client** and a copy of the client's **TGS session key**.
   Message is encrypted with a key only known to the **ticket-granting server**.
 5. **Kerberos Client** recieves the messages:
    1. Decrypts message using the user's *password*.
    2. This provides access to the **TGS session key** [without correct password, you wont get further].

## üö¶IMPLEMENTING KERBEROSüö¶ ##

#### KERBEROS SERVER / Key Distribution Center (KDC) üè∞ ####



Open the hosts file.
```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```
add
```txt
127.0.0.1 kdc.example.com
```
to the following to the ip address list so it looks something like this:
```txt
127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.1.1 ldap
127.0.0.1 kdc.example.com
```

save the file and start installing.
```bash
sudo apt get update
sudo apt install krb5-kdc krb5-admin-server
``` 
Default Kerberos version 5 realm (realm needs to be capital letters):
```txt
EXAMPLE.COM
``` 
Kerberos servers for your realm:
 ```txt
kdc.example.com
```
 Administrative server for your Kerberos realm:      
 ```txt
kdc.example.com
```
**üõëüîê!! PROCTECT THE MASTER KEY !!üîêüõë**
to create the example.com realm run the following command
and you will be prompted to enter a master key, which is very important to store in safe manner.
```bash
sudo krb5_newrealm
```
add a user to manage centrally
```bash
sudo kadmin.local 
```
add a principal, this is what user and services are called 
```bash
addprinc simon 
```
enter a password twice and write 'exit to exit
```bash
exit
```

  edit /etc/krb5.conf file & add the following lines in [domain_realm] section
```txt
.kdc.com = kdc.example.com
kdc.com = kdc.example.com
```

#### CLIENT üñ•Ô∏è ####

```bash
sudo apt get update
sudo apt install krb5-user krb5-config
```
create a file called etc krb5.conf
```bash
dpkg-reconfigure krb5-config
```
Default Kerberos version 5 realm:
```txt
EXAMPLE.COM
```
look at the krb5.conf file and configure (based on your setup perhaps automation tools)
```bash
cat /etc/krb5.confl
```
we will edit /etc/krb5.conf file & add the following lines in [domain_realm] section
```txt
.example.com = kdc.example.com
example.com = kdc.example.com
```

**check if we can communicate with the Kerberos server /KDC** 

```bash
kinit -p simon@EXAMPLE.COM
```
list the details of the ticket with
```bash
klist
```
**Client is ready to request Ticket Granting Server**

## Configuring the system access 
We need to configure access on the system that corresponds to the Kerberos Principle.
Add a user simon
```bash
adduser simon
```
in order to let someone log in, the system needs an account for them to use.
Kerberos should handle the authentication/password and the activation of the user's account on that machine. The kerberos user will map onto the local user when they log in.
[PAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_PAM) support is added for our Kerberized user:
```bash
sudo apt install libpam-krb5.
```
see and control the inclusion of Kerboros in the PAM files:
```bash
grep krb /etc/pam.d/*
```
**Log in as Kerberized user**

Sign in again to the host/virtual machine, switch to a new console.
After signing in use:
```bash
klist
```
verify you get information about the Kerberos Ticket:
```bash

```
#### PROTECTED SERVER üì≠ ####

```bash
sudo apt install krb5 config
```

Edit ***/etc/ssh/sshd_config***

add ***yes*** to following lines:

```txt
GSSAPIAuthentication yes
GSSAPICleanupCredentials yes
```

```bash
restart!!!
```

### KERBEROS SERVER üè∞ ###

  add the ssh server to the kerberos management
  add principal 
  creat a key file
```bash
ktadd  k /tmp/sshserver.kea.dk.keytab
host/sshserver.kea.dk
```
  copy the keyfile to the ssh server /etc directory

```bash
```

### CLIENT üñ•Ô∏è ###

  get the ticket from the kerberos server
```bash
kinit root/admin
klist  A 
```


### SUMMARY OF SETUP ###

  install both kerberos server packages on kerboros server
  install kerberos client package
    add get a a ticket for the user that will login remotely
  on ssh server [protected server] 
    install krb5

## üìñ CRYPTOLOGY: HASHING WEAKNESS


Sources:
<p>  <a href="https://www.rfc editor.org/rfc/rfc8554.html">RFC 8554 </a> </p>

<p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function"> wikipedia. </a></p>

### 3 Weaknesses of Hashing ###



The hashing function must be deterministic in it's output given an input of arbritary size. 
This is the way hashing is used to encode data for more effcient memory utilization.

This is useful, but not the primer goal of hashing in cryptography.

While providing the effectiveness of hashing algorithm's ability to obfuscate information, like password storage in databases, many algorithms have proven to be weak to certain types of attacks.

Therefore, as always, we must carefully research and evalutate any security methodes, before bringing them to production environment.
According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function"> wikipedia <a> the following conditions are met in a secure hash function and it's corresponding output, such as SHA 3 and Argon2.

```
Pre image resistance
Given a hash value h, it should be difficult to find any message m such that h = hash(m). This concept is related to that of a one way function. Functions that lack this property are vulnerable to preimage attacks.
```
```
Second pre image resistance
Given an input m1, it should be difficult to find a different input m2 such that hash(m1) = hash(m2). This property is sometimes referred to as weak collision resistance. Functions that lack this property are vulnerable to second preimage attacks.
```
```
Collision resistance
It should be difficult to find two different messages m1 and m2 such that hash(m1) = hash(m2). Such a pair is called a cryptographic hash collision. This property is sometimes referred to as strong collision resistance. It requires a hash value at least twice as long as that required for pre image resistance; otherwise, collisions may be found by a birthday attack.
```

Attack vectors against hashes (output of the hash functions) count, birthday attacks, preimage attack, second preimage attack.

#### Security / Computational Speed Tradeoff ###

| HASH FUNCTION | SECURITY | SPEED 
| ------        | ------- |  ----- |
| SHA 1         | NOT SECURE | FAST |
| SHA 2         | HIGH    | FAST |
| SHA 3         |  HIGHEST | FAST |
| Argon2         | HIGEHST | SLOW | 
| SHA 256         | HIGH | FAST |
| SHA 512         | VERY HIGH | FAST | 

#### Tools used: ####


| Name |¬†Description | OS |
| ---     | ---            | --   |
| hash identifier | Identifies hash function algorithm based on an output/digest | Linux | 
| <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#input=SGVsbG8gd29ybGQ">Cyber Chef </a> | Online tool for calculating outputs/digests with all major cryptology algorithms | webbrowser |
| John The Ripper | Password cracking tool | Linux |
| Hash Cat | | Linux |




#### Birthday attack ####

Relates to the property, collision resistance. Given the output value, it should be extremely hard to calculate another input value. 

In the case of SHA 256, the security from birthday attacks is given by the 50% of hashing the same output given two distinct hash inputs.

SHA 256 algorithm output birthday attack security level is 2^(256/2) = 2^128 different inputs needed to collide with an existing hash output.

The security level against brithday attacks withing the SHA 1 algorithm output of 160 bits (not secure) is 2^(160/2) = 2^80 different inputs needed to collide with an existing hash output hashed with the same algorithm (SHA 1 of 160 bits).

#### Use Key Derivative Functions for password storage ####

Attackers can download a database of hashed password and attempt to crack the password by comparing salts from already known passwords, and thereby obtain access to matching passwords accounts.

Salting can to some extend prevent attackers success by adding an extra entry/element together with the hashed password. 

***Best practice*** is to couple salting with a Key Derivative Function.

***KDF's, take a key, salt, iterations as inputs.***
The goal is to slow down the process of attempts to bruteforce or use dictionary attakcs to obtain the password or passphrase of a victim.

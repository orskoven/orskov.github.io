## ðŸ“– CRYPTOLOGY: HASHING 


### 4 Properties of Hashing 


**General** 

The hashing function must be deterministic in it's output given an input of arbritary size. 
This is the way hashing is used to encode data for more effcient memory utilization.

This is useful, but not the primer goal of hashing in cryptography.

While providing the effectiveness of hashing algorithm's ability to obfuscate information, like password storage in databases, many algorithms have proven to be weak to certain types of attacks.

Therefore, as always, we must carefully research and evalutate any security methodes, before bringing them to production environment.



**Preimage resistance:**

When a hash function is able to generate the same hash output for the same

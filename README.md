# 🛡️ Exercise 13: Rootkit Defense, Tripwire/AIDE Monitoring, and Incident Response (Full Tutorial)

**Author:** Cybersecurity Consultant (Enterprise Audit & Risk Perspective)
**Audience:** Security Analysts, SOC Engineers, Cybersecurity Students
**Level:** Intermediate – Advanced
**Purpose:** Understand, detect, and respond to advanced threats like rootkits and ransomware using tools like **Tripwire** or **AIDE**.

---

## 📘 13.a — Understanding Rootkits

### 🔍 What Is a Rootkit?

A **rootkit** is a type of malicious software designed to hide its presence or the presence of other malicious software. It gives attackers root-level access to a system while remaining undetected.

### 🔬 Key Characteristics

| Feature                  | Description                                                                |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stealth**              | Rootkits hide processes, files, logs, and network activity from detection. |
| **Persistence**          | Can survive reboots or reinstallations (especially kernel-level rootkits). |
| **Privilege Escalation** | Often used to maintain or escalate system access privileges.               |

### 🧠 Types of Rootkits

* **User-mode**: Operates in user space (e.g., via LD\_PRELOAD).
* **Kernel-mode**: Hooks kernel system calls, hardest to detect.
* **Bootkits**: Infect the bootloader or firmware (BIOS/UEFI).
* **Firmware**: Hides in device firmware (e.g., NICs, drives).

### 📚 Recommended Reading

* **SANS Paper**: *"Linux Rootkits for Beginners"* – Introduction to rootkit behavior and detection.
* **Modern Update**: Rootkit techniques today often use virtualization evasion, BIOS/UEFI implants, or cloud persistence (e.g., container rootkits).

### 🔄 What's Changed?

* Legacy rootkits focused on file-system manipulation.
* **Modern rootkits** increasingly focus on:

  * Kernel Module Injection
  * Evasion in EDR/XDR environments
  * Containerized or ephemeral infrastructure

## 🧰 13.b — Installing & Using Tripwire (or AIDE)

### 🧪 Step-by-Step: Tripwire Installation & Setup

#### 1. 🔧 Install Tripwire

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install tripwire
```

You will be prompted to set a **site key** and **local passphrase**—keep these secure!

---

#### 2. 📁 Choose Directories to Monitor

Edit the configuration to define which parts of the system Tripwire should monitor.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt
```

Example directories to monitor:

```
/etc
/bin
/sbin
/var
/usr
/root
```

> Be mindful not to monitor volatile directories like `/tmp` or `/proc`.

---

#### 3. 🏗️ Initialize the Tripwire Database

```bash
sudo tripwire --init
```

This creates a cryptographically signed baseline snapshot of your system.

---

#### 4. 🧪 Test Tripwire

Create and modify files in monitored directories:

```bash
sudo touch /etc/testfile.txt
sudo echo "modified" >> /etc/passwd
```

Now run Tripwire's check:

```bash
sudo tripwire --check
```

### ✅ Expected Output

Tripwire will alert to **new files** and **changes in critical system files**.

---

#### 5. 🔁 Automate via Crontab

Edit crontab to run every 20 minutes:

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

Add:

```bash
*/20 * * * * /usr/sbin/tripwire --check > /var/log/tripwire_check.log 2>&1
```

---

#### 6. 🔄 Alternatives

| Tool     | Features                         | Comments                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Tripwire | Cryptographic integrity checking | Payable version offers GUI & SIEM   |
| AIDE     | Simpler config, open-source      | Lightweight alternative to Tripwire |

## 💻 13.c — Simulated Rootkit Attack Lab (Optional but Highly Recommended)

### 🔧 Prepare a Scratch VM

1. **Create new Linux VM** in VMware.
2. Take an initial **snapshot**.
3. Install Tripwire or AIDE as described above.

---

### 🦠 Install a Test Rootkit (For Educational Purposes Only)

> ⚠️ **WARNING:** Only do this in an **isolated lab environment**!

Download rootkits (e.g., `knark`, `adore`, `bo2k`) from:

```
https://packetstormsecurity.com/UNIX/penetration/rootkits/
```

Example:

```bash
wget https://packetstormsecurity.com/.../adore-ng.tar.gz
```

Unpack and install per included instructions.

---

### 🧪 Detect with Tripwire

1. **Run the rootkit**.
2. **Run Tripwire check** again:

   ```bash
   sudo tripwire --check
   ```
3. If changes go **undetected**, add files/binaries associated with the rootkit manually into Tripwire's policy.

Edit:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt
```

Then reinitialize:

```bash
sudo tripwire --init
```

---

## 🚨 13.d — Incident Response Procedures

### 🛑 Rootkit Detection Procedure

**Objective**: Isolate, preserve, and respond without alerting the attacker.

#### 🧭 Step-by-Step Response

| Step                      | Description                                                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Isolate Host**       | Disconnect from the network immediately.                   |
| **2. Preserve Evidence**  | Take disk and memory snapshot before any shutdown.         |
| **3. Use Trusted Boot**   | Reboot from a clean live CD or USB, not the infected OS.   |
| **4. Forensic Analysis**  | Use tools like Volatility, chkrootkit, rkhunter.           |
| **5. Reimage System**     | Wipe and rebuild from clean sources.                       |
| **6. Rotate Credentials** | Assume credentials were compromised.                       |
| **7. Report**             | Log the incident and notify internal/external authorities. |

### 🎯 Justification

Rebuilding ensures full trust. Rootkits can compromise logs, binaries, and kernel modules beyond recovery.

---

### 🧨 Ransomware Handling Procedure

**Objective**: Contain, mitigate spread, restore business continuity.

#### 🧭 Response Plan

| Step                       | Description                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Contain Infection**   | Isolate affected systems (network segmentation or shutdown).  |
| **2. Identify Scope**      | Run network scans and logs to find lateral movement.          |
| **3. Do NOT Pay**          | Paying incentivizes attackers and may not guarantee recovery. |
| **4. Restore from Backup** | Only after confirming backup integrity.                       |
| **5. Notify Authorities**  | Ransomware often involves criminal actors (e.g., FBI, CERT).  |
| **6. Post-Mortem Review**  | Patch vulnerability, educate staff, and update disaster plan. |

### 🎯 Justification

Paying ransom is not only discouraged by law enforcement but is no guarantee of recovery. A good backup and containment strategy are your best defenses.

---

## 🚨 **PortSentry Setup & Configuration**

**PortSentry** is a tool designed to detect and protect against unauthorized port scans, blocking the IP addresses that perform the scans using firewall rules like **iptables**.

### 🧰 **Task 1: Install PortSentry on Ubuntu Server**

1. **Update the package list:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

2. **Install PortSentry:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install portsentry
   ```

   After installation, the configuration file for PortSentry will be available at `/etc/portsentry/portsentry.conf`.

---

### 🔧 **Task 2: Configure PortSentry**

1. **Open the PortSentry configuration file for editing:**

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/portsentry/portsentry.conf
   ```

2. **Modify the following settings based on your test requirements:**

   * **Test 1: Protect a few ports from visibility outside the local network:**
     In the `portsentry.conf` file, configure which ports you want to monitor. If you want to protect ports `22` (SSH), `80` (HTTP), and `443` (HTTPS), add them as follows:

     ```bash
     TCP_PORTS="22,80,443"
     UDP_PORTS="22,80,443"
     ```

     To restrict visibility to your local network, you can adjust **iptables** in the next step.

   * **Test 2: Add a few ports that do not exist (for testing purposes):**
     You can add some non-existent ports to simulate scanning of invalid ports. Example:

     ```bash
     TCP_PORTS="99999,88888"
     UDP_PORTS="99999,88888"
     ```

   * **Test 3: Block all UDP and TCP ports:**
     If you want to block all UDP and TCP traffic for testing, use:

     ```bash
     TCP_PORTS="all"
     UDP_PORTS="all"
     ```

   * **Uncomment the iptables filter rule:**
     Look for the line related to `iptables` and uncomment it to activate firewall protection:

     ```bash
     # Uncomment the following line to activate iptables filtering
     IPTABLES -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 12345 -j DROP
     ```

     **Why uncomment the iptables rule?**
     This ensures that PortSentry uses **iptables** to block access to ports that are being scanned, helping to protect your server from unauthorized access.

3. **Save and close the configuration file** by pressing `CTRL+O`, then `CTRL+X`.

---

### 🕵️‍♂️ **Task 3: Test PortSentry Configurations**

1. **Install Nmap on another Linux machine** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install nmap
   ```

2. **Run a TCP scan on your Ubuntu server** from the other machine:

   ```bash
   nmap -p 1-65535 <target-server-ip>
   ```

3. **Run a UDP scan on your Ubuntu server**:

   ```bash
   nmap -sU -p 1-65535 <target-server-ip>
   ```

4. After running the scans, check the logs to see that PortSentry has blocked the scanning IPs:

   ```bash
   sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
   ```

   You should observe that PortSentry has blocked scanning attempts based on your configuration.

---

## 🖥️ **Squid Proxy Setup & Configuration**

**Squid Proxy** is a high-performance proxy server that supports HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and caching. It can be configured to block websites based on their domain, content, or keywords.

### 🧰 **Task 1: Install Squid Proxy on Ubuntu Server**

1. **Update the package list:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

2. **Install Squid Proxy:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install squid3
   ```

3. After installation, the Squid configuration file is located at `/etc/squid3/squid.conf`.

---

### 🔧 **Task 2: Configure Squid Proxy Filters**

1. **Open the Squid configuration file for editing:**

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/squid3/squid.conf
   ```

2. **Set proxy filters based on domain:**
   To block traffic to `.se`, `.ru`, and `.ch` domains, add the following Access Control Lists (ACLs) and HTTP access rules:

   ```bash
   acl blocked_sites dstdomain .se .ru .ch
   http_access deny blocked_sites
   ```

3. **Set proxy filters based on content:**
   To block traffic containing certain strings (such as "Sverige", "Sweden", "drop table", and "insert"), you can use regular expressions (regex). Add the following lines:

   ```bash
   acl blocked_content url_regex -i Sverige
   acl blocked_content url_regex -i Sweden
   acl blocked_content url_regex -i "drop table"
   acl blocked_content url_regex -i "insert"
   http_access deny blocked_content
   ```

   **Why block "drop table" and "insert" strings?**
   Blocking these SQL-related strings helps prevent **SQL injection attacks**, which involve attackers attempting to manipulate databases using malicious queries.

4. **Save and close the file** (`CTRL+O`, then `CTRL+X`).

---

### 🔄 **Task 3: Testing Squid Proxy Filters**

1. **Restart Squid to apply the configuration:**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart squid
   ```

2. **Configure your browser to use the Squid Proxy:**

   * In Firefox, go to `Preferences > Network Settings > Manual Proxy Configuration`.
   * Set `HTTP Proxy` to the IP of your Squid server and use the default port `3128`.

3. **Test the Filters:**

   * Try to access websites with `.se`, `.ru`, and `.ch` domains to verify they are blocked.
   * Try accessing websites that contain "Sverige", "Sweden", "drop table", or "insert" to ensure these are also blocked.

---

## 📚 **Conclusion**

You have successfully installed and configured **PortSentry** to protect your server from port scanning and **Squid Proxy** to filter web traffic based on domain and content. These configurations help to reduce the attack surface of your network by:

* **PortSentry**: Blocking unauthorized port scans and reducing the risk of exploitation.
* **Squid Proxy**: Filtering web traffic and blocking potential malicious content, which helps prevent common attack vectors like SQL injection.

---

### 🔐 **Next Steps**

* **PortSentry**: Review the firewall rules periodically and refine the port protections based on your organization’s needs.
* **Squid Proxy**: Extend the filtering rules to block additional harmful domains or content types, and consider enabling logging to monitor traffic for suspicious activity.

This guide has equipped you with practical knowledge of securing your Ubuntu server against scanning attacks and controlling web traffic.

Here is a **complete professional cybersecurity tutorial** in **Markdown format**, following a McKinsey-style consulting approach for configuring and using **Tripwire** (or **AIDE**) for file integrity monitoring.

---

# 🛡️ File Integrity Monitoring with Tripwire (or AIDE)

**Module:** System Security – Notes 15
**Author:** Kristoffer Miklas
**Goal:** Learn how to use Tripwire (or AIDE) to monitor critical system files and detect unauthorized changes.

---

## 📌 Objectives

* ✅ Install and configure **Tripwire** for file integrity checking.
* ✅ Define which directories and files to monitor.
* ✅ Initialize the baseline database.
* ✅ Simulate file tampering and detect it.
* ✅ Automate monitoring using **cron**.
* ✅ Compare Tripwire with AIDE as an alternative.

---

## 🧰 Step 1: Installation

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install tripwire
```

* During installation, you'll be prompted to:

  * Set a **site passphrase** (used for signing policies and configurations).
  * Set a **local passphrase** (used for signing the database and reports).

> 💡 **Security Tip:** Use strong, separate passphrases and store them securely.

---

## ⚙️ Step 2: Configure What to Protect

Edit the Tripwire **policy file**:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt
```

> Focus on sensitive directories such as:

```text
/etc
/bin
/sbin
/usr/bin
/usr/sbin
/var/log
/root
```

### Example Entry:

```text
(
  rulename = "Critical System Binaries",
  severity = 100
)
{
  /bin -> $(ReadOnly) ;
  /sbin -> $(ReadOnly) ;
}
```

Once modified, compile the policy:

```bash
sudo twadmin --create-polfile /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt
```

---

## 🧱 Step 3: Initialize the Tripwire Database

This creates a snapshot of the system’s current state:

```bash
sudo tripwire --init
```

* The database will be created in: `/var/lib/tripwire/HOSTNAME.twd`
* This baseline will be compared against future scans.

---

## 🔬 Step 4: Test Tripwire (Integrity Check)

Simulate common threats:

1. **Create a new file:**

   ```bash
   sudo touch /etc/new-config.conf
   ```

2. **Modify an existing file:**

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/hosts
   ```

3. **Run Tripwire:**

   ```bash
   sudo tripwire --check
   ```

### 📄 Result:

Tripwire generates a report showing **added**, **modified**, or **deleted** files.

Check the report for:

* ✅ Severity score
* 🧩 Type of change
* 🛠️ Suggested actions

---

## 🛠️ Step 5: Review the Report

Reports are stored in:

```bash
/var/lib/tripwire/report/
```

To **view a report**:

```bash
sudo twprint --print-report --twrfile /var/lib/tripwire/report/<filename>.twr
```

---

## ⏱️ Step 6: Automate Tripwire with Cron

Add a scheduled integrity check every 20 minutes:

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

Add the following line:

```bash
*/20 * * * * /usr/sbin/tripwire --check > /var/log/tripwire/cron_report.txt 2>&1
```

> 🧠 **Best Practice:** Combine with log monitoring to alert admins via email or SIEM.

---

## 🔁 Step 7: Update the Database After Legit Changes

When legitimate changes are made (e.g., updates), use:

```bash
sudo tripwire --update --twrfile /var/lib/tripwire/report/<latest>.twr
```

Tripwire will prompt to accept/deny each change.

---

## 🔄 Alternative Tool: AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment)

### Pros of AIDE:

* Lightweight and faster
* Easier to configure for basic setups
* Simpler database update process

### To install AIDE:

```bash
sudo apt-get install aide
```

### Initialize database:

```bash
sudo aideinit
```

### Run scan:

```bash
sudo aide --check
```

## 📌 Objectives

> "You cannot secure what you cannot see." — Security Engineering Principle

This tutorial covers:

1. 🔄 **Remote Logging Configuration using `rsyslog`**
2. 🔍 **System Auditing using `Lynis`**
3. 📊 **Analysis & Reflection: Security Posture Insights**
4. ✅ **Deliverables & Documentation Guidelines**

---

## 🗂️ Exercise 15.a: Remote Logging with rsyslog

### 🎯 Goal:

Send logs from one VMware Linux server to another remote logging server for redundancy, integrity, and forensic readiness.

---

### 🛠️ Step-by-Step Implementation

#### 🔧 1. **Prepare the Remote Log Server**

```bash
sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.conf
```

* **Uncomment** the following lines to allow remote log reception:

```conf
# provides UDP syslog reception
module(load="imudp")
input(type="imudp" port="514")

# provides TCP syslog reception
module(load="imtcp")
input(type="imtcp" port="514")
```

* **Prefer TCP over UDP**:

  * **TCP** = Reliable, ordered delivery, better for security logs.
  * **UDP** = Lightweight, but risk of log loss.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart rsyslog
sudo ufw allow 514/tcp
```

---

#### 💻 2. **Configure the Local Machine to Send Logs**

```bash
sudo nano /etc/rsyslog.d/10-remote.conf
```

* Add the following to send all logs:

```conf
*.*    @@REMOTE_SERVER_IP:514
```

> The `@` denotes UDP, `@@` denotes TCP. Always prefer TCP in professional environments.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart rsyslog
```

---

| SNMPv3       | ✅    | ✅          | ✅ Production    |

---

## 🌐 PHASE 2: ADDING SERVICES & MONITORED HOSTS

### 🔁 Exercise 1: Add Basic Monitoring for Localhost

Edit:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nagios4/objects/localhost.cfg
```

Add or validate:

```cfg
define service {
  use                 local-service
  host_name           localhost
  service_description Root Partition
  check_command       check_all_disks!20%!10%
}
```

Check config and restart:

```bash
sudo nagios4 -v /etc/nagios4/nagios.cfg
sudo service nagios4 restart
```

---

### 🧪 Exercise 2: Install and Monitor a New Service

Install FTP:

```bash
sudo apt install vsftpd
```

Add this to `localhost.cfg`:

```cfg
define service {
  use                 local-service
  host_name           localhost
  service_description FTP
  check_command       check_ftp
}
```

---

## 🛰️ PHASE 3: REMOTE HOST & SNMP MONITORING (Kali + OIDs)

### 🔍 \[NM.03] SNMP Monitor (Kali + Object Identifier)

```ascii
╭─────────────────────────────╮
│ Ubuntu (Nagios Server)     │
│  └─ Monitors Kali via SNMP │
╰─────────────────────────────╯
            │
     SNMPv2c Poll
            ↓
╭─────────────────────────────╮
│ Kali (SNMP Sim / Target)   │
│  └─ Responds to OID Probe  │
╰─────────────────────────────╯
```

---

### 🔧 Create Kali Config: `/etc/nagios4/conf.d/kali.cfg`

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nagios4/conf.d/kali.cfg
```

Paste and modify IP accordingly:

```cfg
define host {
  use                 linux-server
  host_name           kali
  alias               kali
  address             192.168.234.131
}

define service {
  use                 local-service
  host_name           kali
  service_description PING
  check_command       check_ping!100.0,20%!500.0,60%
}

define service {
  use                 local-service
  host_name           kali
  service_description HTTP
  check_command       check_http
  notifications_enabled 0
}

define service {
  use                 local-service
  host_name           kali
  service_description TimeTicks
  check_command       check_snmp!-o 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.8.0 -C recorded/linksys-system -P 2c
  notifications_enabled 0
}
```

---

### 🧪 Test Your SNMP Plugin Directly

```bash
/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_snmp -H 192.168.234.131 -o 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.8.0 -C recorded/linksys-system -P 2c
```

✅ Should return something like:

```
SNMP OK - Timeticks: (123456) 0:20:34.56
```

---

### 🔧 Update `commands.cfg` if necessary

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nagios4/objects/commands.cfg
```

Ensure this exists:

```cfg
define command {
  command_name    check_snmp
  command_line    /usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_snmp -H $HOSTADDRESS$ $ARG1$
}
```

> `check_snmp! -o <OID> -C <community> -P <version>` ← this is how Nagios parses it

---

## 📦 \[NM.04] ADDITIONAL HOST MONITORING

### Add Another Host (Optional)

* Example: SOF-ELK, pfSense, NIDS

```cfg
define host {
  use                 linux-server
  host_name           elk-siem
  alias               ELK
  address             192.168.234.150
}

define service {
  use                 local-service
  host_name           elk-siem
  service_description Logstash Status
  check_command       check_tcp!5044
}
```

___

Absolutely. Here's an **expert-level cybersecurity tutorial** in **Markdown** for building an **SNMP lab with SNMP Simulator** on **Kali Linux**. It's structured, professional, and tailored for hands-on security training, DFIR, and network protocol analysis.

---

# 🧪 SNMP LAB | SNMP SIMULATOR on Kali Linux

> 🎯 **Goal**: Simulate SNMP-enabled network devices for monitoring, enumeration, and security testing (Red Team & Blue Team perspectives).

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

* ✅ **Kali Linux** (up-to-date)
* ✅ Internet access
* ✅ Basic Bash & SNMP knowledge

---

## 🛠️ Step 1: Install Required SNMP Tools

### 🔧 Install Core SNMP Utilities and MIB Packages

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y \
  snmp \
  snmp-mibs-downloader
```

> This installs `snmpwalk`, `snmpget`, `snmpset`, and MIB support.

---

## 🛠️ Step 2: Install SNMP Simulator (`snmpsim`)

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y snmpsim
```

> ⏳ *This may take 10–15 minutes depending on your system.*

---

## 📁 Step 3: Prepare SNMP Simulator Directories

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /usr/snmpsim/data
sudo mkdir -p /var/log/snmpsim/161/2NetworkCoreDFIRAttacks
```

> 🔒 Use `-p` to create nested directories in one command.

---

## 📁 Step 4: Load Example SNMP Data

```bash
sudo cp -r /usr/share/doc/snmpsim/examples/data/* /usr/snmpsim/data/
```

> This populates your simulator with **prebuilt SNMP data profiles**, simulating real-world devices like Cisco routers and printers.

---

## 🚀 Step 5: Run SNMP Simulator

Launch the SNMP agent on **UDP port 161** (standard SNMP port):

```bash
sudo snmpsimd --agent-udpv4-endpoint=0.0.0.0:161 --process-user=nobody --process-group=nogroup --logging-method=file:/var/log/snmpsim/snmpsimd.log
```

> 💡 You can modify `--agent-udp-endpoint` to simulate multiple devices on different ports or IPs (e.g. `192.168.56.101:161`, `127.0.0.1:16101`).

---

## 🧪 Step 6: Test SNMP Access

Use `snmpwalk` to verify SNMP simulation is working.

```bash
snmpwalk -v2c -c public 127.0.0.1
```

### 🔍 Targeting Specific OID Example:

```bash
snmpget -v2c -c public 127.0.0.1 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0
```

> Should return simulated system name: `SNMP Simulator device`

---

## 🛡️ Blue Team Use Cases

* 🧠 Practice parsing **SNMP Traps**
* 📊 Baseline normal SNMP telemetry
* 🛑 Detect anomalous polling behavior (e.g., brute force community strings)
* 🔎 Integrate simulated SNMP into **SIEM** (Splunk, ELK)

---

## 🧨 Red Team Use Cases

* 🔓 Practice SNMP enumeration on "live" targets
* 🔐 Test password reuse on SNMP community strings (`public`, `private`)
* 📦 Exploit SNMP write access (via `snmpset`)
* 🧬 Observe how traps could be abused for covert signaling

---

## 🔄 Bonus: Simulate Multiple SNMP Devices

### Run multiple agents:

```bash
sudo snmpsim-command-responder \
  --data-dir=/usr/snmpsim/data \
  --agent-udp-endpoint=127.0.0.1:16101 &
  
sudo snmpsim-command-responder \
  --data-dir=/usr/snmpsim/data \
  --agent-udp-endpoint=127.0.0.1:16102 &
```

Now query each one independently:

```bash
snmpwalk -v2c -c public 127.0.0.1:16101
snmpwalk -v2c -c public 127.0.0.1:16102
```

---

## 🧰 Common SNMP Enumeration Commands

```bash
snmpwalk -v2c -c public 127.0.0.1
snmpget -v2c -c public 127.0.0.1 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0
snmpbulkwalk -v2c -c public 127.0.0.1
snmpset -v2c -c private 127.0.0.1 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 s "pwned-by-redteam"
```

---

## 📁 Lab Directory Structure (after setup)

```bash
/usr/snmpsim/
├── data/
│   ├── cisco.snmprec
│   ├── printer.snmprec
│   └── windows.snmprec
/var/log/snmpsim/
└── 161/
    └── 2NetworkCoreDFIRAttacks/
```

---

Great news — your Nagios configuration **passed the pre-flight check** with:

> ✅ **"Things look okay - No serious problems were detected during the pre-flight check"**

And you restarted the service successfully with:

```bash
sudo service nagios4 restart
```

To help others (or yourself later), here's a well-designed **Markdown Troubleshooting & Restart Guide for Nagios 4**, with all the steps laid out in a clean, user-friendly format.

---

# 🛠️ Nagios 4 Troubleshooting & Restart Guide

This guide helps you fix common Nagios startup issues and ensure a clean service restart.

---

## 📋 1. **Check Config Files for Errors**

Before restarting Nagios, **validate** the configuration using the built-in verification tool:

```bash
sudo nagios4 -v /etc/nagios4/nagios.cfg
```

### ✅ Expected Output:

---

## 🔄 3. **Restart Nagios Safely**

Once your config is clean:

```bash
sudo service nagios4 restart
```

Or, using `systemctl`:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nagios4
```

Then confirm it's running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status nagios4
```

You should see:

```bash
Active: active (running)
```

---

## 🌐 4. **Check the Web Interface**

After restarting, go to:

```
http://localhost/nagios4
```

Or:

```
http://<your-server-ip>/nagios4
```

### 🧾 If You Still See:

> "Could not read host and service status information"

It means Nagios still isn't starting properly. Re-run:

```bash
sudo nagios4 -v /etc/nagios4/nagios.cfg
```

And check for any errors.

---

## 🧰 5. **File Permissions Fix (Optional)**

If status files are missing or unreadable, reset file permissions:

```bash
sudo chown -R nagios:nagios /var/lib/nagios4/
sudo chown -R nagios:www-data /var/cache/nagios4/
sudo chmod -R 775 /var/lib/nagios4 /var/cache/nagios4
```

Then restart:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nagios4
```

---

## ✅ Final Checklist

* [x] Config verified with `nagios4 -v`
* [x] Duplicate definitions removed
* [x] Nagios restarted successfully
* [x] Web UI shows host/service status
* [x] No "bailing out" errors in `/var/log/nagios4/nagios.log`

Absolutely — here’s how to **inspect, verify, and analyze SNMP communication using `tshark`** on Kali Linux. These additions elevate your lab with **network forensics, protocol dissection**, and **real-time packet analysis**, key skills in **Red Team ops**, **Blue Team threat hunting**, and **DFIR investigations**.

---

# 🧪 SNMP LAB ENHANCEMENT | 🔍 Traffic Inspection with `tshark`

> 🎯 **Goal**: Monitor, inspect, and validate SNMP packets sent and received using Wireshark’s CLI tool `tshark`.

---

## 🛠️ Step 7: Install `tshark`

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y tshark
```

> 📦 `tshark` is the CLI version of **Wireshark**, ideal for scripting and headless inspection.

---

## 🔍 Step 8: Capture SNMP Traffic in Real Time

### ✅ Basic Packet Capture on UDP Port 161

```bash
sudo tshark -i lo -f "udp port 161"
```

> 📡 This captures SNMP packets on the **loopback interface** (`lo`). If your SNMP simulator runs on another interface (e.g., `eth0`, `tun0`, `br0`), replace `lo` accordingly.

---

### 📄 Save to PCAP File for Further Analysis

```bash
sudo tshark -i lo -f "udp port 161" -w snmp_lab_capture.pcap
```

> Analyze later using Wireshark or send it to a forensic suite.

---

### 🧵 Live Decode of SNMP Data

```bash
sudo tshark -i lo -f "udp port 161" -Y "snmp" -V
```

> `-V` = verbose decode of **SNMP layer**, showing OIDs, values, community strings.

---

## 📌 Step 9: Trigger & Observe SNMP Activity

From another terminal, trigger SNMP activity to generate traffic:

```bash
snmpwalk -v2c -c public 127.0.0.1
```

Then watch `tshark` output to **validate**:

* SNMP version
* Community string (`public`)
* Requested OIDs
* SNMP Response values

---

### 📊 Example Output (tshark -V)

```
SNMP
  version: v2c (1)
  community: public
  data: get-request (0)
    request-id: 12345
    error-status: noError (0)
    error-index: 0
    variable-bindings: 1 item
      1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0 (sysDescr)
```

---

## 🧪 Step 10: Validate Simulator Responses

```bash
snmpget -v2c -c public 127.0.0.1 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0
```

Then match response in `tshark`:

```bash
community: public
data: get-response
  sysName.0 = "SNMP Simulator device"
```

---

## 🧰 Advanced Traffic Filters

### 🔎 Filter Only SNMP Get-Requests

```bash
sudo tshark -i lo -Y "snmp.pdu.type == 0" -V
```

> SNMP Get-Request = Type `0`

### 🔎 Filter Only SNMP Get-Responses

```bash
sudo tshark -i lo -Y "snmp.pdu.type == 2" -V
```

> SNMP Get-Response = Type `2`

### 🔍 Filter Based on OID

```bash
sudo tshark -i lo -Y "snmp.oid contains 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0"
```

---

## 💡 Tip: List Interfaces for Capture

```bash
tshark -D
```

> Use this to find the correct interface (`eth0`, `lo`, `wlan0`, etc.) for traffic inspection.

---

## 📂 Bonus: Filter and Extract SNMP Values from a Capture File

```bash
tshark -r snmp_lab_capture.pcap -Y "snmp" -T fields -e snmp.oid -e snmp.value
```

> 🎯 Useful for scripting and reporting OID enumerations.

---

Here’s a **restructured, expert-grade Markdown chapter** incorporating your extended input, with **technical clarity**, **precise SNMP internals**, **ASCII diagrams**, and **clean formatting**. This version integrates deep SNMP and MIB insights, protocol operations, message structure, and **SNMPv3** security.

---

# 🧠 Deep Dive: SNMP, MIBs, and Network Monitoring

---

## 🔧 What is a MIB?

A **Management Information Base (MIB)** is a structured collection of managed objects defined for a device or system. It acts as the **dictionary of monitorable and configurable parameters** via SNMP.

### 📚 Think of a MIB as:

* An **advanced configuration database**.
* A **catalog of OIDs** (Object Identifiers).
* A **blueprint of accessible telemetry** on devices like routers, switches, firewalls, etc.

---

## 🔍 MIB Components & Example Use Cases

A MIB can be used to monitor:

| Device           | Metrics via MIB                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Cisco Router** | CPU Utilization, RAM Usage, Interface Errors |
|                  | MAC addresses per port, Throughput           |
|                  | IP packet counters (e.g., `ipInDelivers`)    |

### 🏗️ MIB Example Object:

```plaintext
OBJECT-TYPE: ipInDelivers
SYNTAX:      Counter32
MAX-ACCESS:  read-only
STATUS:      current
DESCRIPTION: The number of input IP packets delivered to upper layers.
```

---

## 🔗 Object Identifier (OID) Structure

An **OID** uniquely identifies a managed object in a MIB. These are hierarchical dot-notation numbers.

### 🧬 OID Example

```plaintext
1.3.6.1.2.1.4.9.0  --> ipInDelivers
```

| Level | Meaning                |
| ----- | ---------------------- |
| 1     | ISO                    |
| 3     | org                    |
| 6     | dod (Dept. of Defense) |
| 1     | internet               |
| 2     | mgmt                   |
| 1     | mib-2                  |
| 4     | ip                     |
| 9     | ipInDelivers           |

> 🔎 This structure is defined using **SMI (Structure of Management Information)**, a data definition language for SNMP.

---

### 🛠️ Additional Troubleshooting Tips

* **Check Network Connectivity:** Ensure your system has a working internet connection.

  ```bash
  ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
  ```

* **Use a Different Mirror:** If issues persist, consider switching to a different Kali mirror. You can configure this using the `kali-tweaks` tool:([Kali Forums][5])

  ```bash
  sudo apt install kali-tweaks
  sudo kali-tweaks
  ```

Navigate to the "Repositories" section and select a different mirror. ([Kali Forums][5])

* **Proxy Settings:** If you're behind a proxy, ensure your proxy settings are correctly configured in `/etc/apt/apt.conf`. Add the following lines, replacing `proxy` and `port` with your actual proxy details:([Magenaut][2])

  ```bash
  Acquire::http::proxy "http://proxy:port/";
  Acquire::ftp::proxy "ftp://proxy:port/";
  Acquire::https::proxy "https://proxy:port/";

The error message you're encountering is due to Kali Linux's implementation of [PEP 668](https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/), which restricts direct modifications to the system's Python environment to prevent potential conflicts between system-managed and user-installed packages. This is particularly relevant when attempting to install Python packages globally using `sudo pip install`.

### Recommended Solutions

#### 1. **Use a Virtual Environment**

Creating a virtual environment allows you to install and manage Python packages independently of the system's Python environment.

1. **Install the `python3-venv` package** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3-venv
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv ~/volatility3-venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   source ~/volatility3-venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install the required packages**:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -e ".[full]"
   ```

   When you're done, deactivate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

#### 2. **Use `pipx` for Application Installation**

If you're looking to install Python applications (like Volatility 3) and prefer not to manage a virtual environment manually, `pipx` is a suitable tool.

1. **Install `pipx`**:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install pipx
   ```

2. **Ensure `pipx`'s binary directory is in your `PATH`**:

   ```bash
   pipx ensurepath
   ```

   After running this command, restart your terminal or log out and back in to apply the changes.

3. **Install Volatility 3 using `pipx`**:

   ```bash
   pipx install git+https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3.git
   ```

   This command installs Volatility 3 in an isolated environment managed by `pipx`, avoiding conflicts with the system Python environment.

#### 3. **Override the Restriction (Not Recommended)**

If you understand the risks and still wish to proceed with installing packages globally, you can override the restriction using the `--break-system-packages` flag:

```bash
sudo pip install --break-system-packages -e ".[full]"
```

**Caution**: This approach can lead to conflicts between system-managed and user-installed packages, potentially breaking system tools that depend on Python.

---

**Note**: The recommended approach is to use a virtual environment or `pipx` to manage Python packages. These methods provide isolation, reducing the risk of conflicts and ensuring system stability.

Let me know if you need further assistance with any of these methods.

### Explanation:

1. **Pulling Docker images**: The script pulls the required Docker images for Kibana, Elasticsearch, Filebeat, and `nfcapd`.
2. **Running containers**: Each container is started in detached mode (`-d`) and mapped to the appropriate ports.
3. **Waiting for initialization**: The script waits for 20 seconds to allow containers to initialize fully. You can adjust the wait time based on your environment.
4. **Testing the services**:

   * It checks if Kibana is accessible at `localhost:5601`.
   * It checks if Elasticsearch is accessible at `localhost:9200`.
   * It checks if `nfcapd` is accessible at port `9995`.
   * It checks if Filebeat is running (as it doesn't have a web service, just verifies it is running).
5. **Stopping and cleaning up**: After testing, the containers are stopped. Optionally, you can uncomment the line that removes the containers (`docker rm`).

### Usage:

1. **Save the script**: Copy the script into a file, e.g., `test_docker_containers.sh`.

2. **Make it executable**:

   ```bash
   chmod +x test_docker_containers.sh
   ```

3. **Run the script**:

   ```bash
   ./test_docker_containers.sh
   ```

### Notes:

* The script assumes you have Docker installed and running on your system.
* If you're running Docker on macOS/Windows through Docker Desktop, you can access the containers via `localhost` (127.0.0.1).
* Adjust the `sleep` time if the containers need more time to initialize.

Let me know if you need further customization or any other help!

### 🔄 Goal

* **Maintain NAT between Mac ↔ Kali Linux VM** (handled by VMware Fusion).
* **Ensure inter-container communication (ELK, Suricata, Zeek, etc.) within Kali**.
* **Avoid `network_mode: host`**, which bypasses NAT and can break communication in a virtualized NAT environment on **macOS**.

---

### ✅ Key Fixes:

* Replace `network_mode: host` with **custom Docker bridge networks**.
* Explicitly **attach all containers** to the same Docker network for seamless communication.
* Set correct interfaces for packet capture (`ens34`) but ensure **interfaces are accessible from within containers**—this may require interface pass-through or `macvlan` if host interface capture is needed.

### 🔍 Important Notes:

1. **Interface Name**:

   * You may need to **map `ens34` to container eth0** using `macvlan` if you require direct packet sniffing from that interface.
   * Otherwise, **pass mirrored traffic** from the host or tap into traffic using pcap with a mount.

2. **Host Interface Access** (e.g., for Suricata/Zeek):

   * On macOS with Fusion + NAT, using `host` mode is **problematic**.
   * Use **`--net=macvlan`** outside Compose if true interface access is needed.

3. **Cross-VM communication**:

   * Ensure Fusion’s NAT is properly forwarding or bridging traffic from Kali to your macOS network stack.
   * Optionally, expose `5601`, `9200`, and other ports via Fusion port forwarding.

---

Would you like me to provide a working `macvlan` example or a script to simulate mirrored traffic to `eth0` for testing Suricata and Zeek?

To run your Docker Compose setup on **Kali Linux in VMware Fusion** (or any Linux system), follow these steps:

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step: Run Docker Compose

#### 1. 🛠 Install Docker and Docker Compose (if not already)

If you haven’t already:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

> Confirm Docker is installed:

```bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

---

#### 2. 📁 Prepare the Project Directory

Create a directory for your project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir ~/nids-elk-stack && cd ~/nids-elk-stack
```

Place the following files inside this directory:

* `docker-compose.yml` (your full setup)
* `suricata.yaml`
* `filebeat.yml`
* Any build contexts like:

  * `./nids-light/Dockerfile`
  * `./elk-siem21suricatafull/Dockerfile`

---

#### 3. 🏗️ Build and Start the Stack

Run the following command to **build and launch** the services:

```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d --build
```

* `-d` runs it in the background (detached).
* `--build` ensures it rebuilds custom Docker images (`nids-light`, `elk-siem21suricatafull`).

---

#### 4. ✅ Check Running Services

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see all your containers running, including `elasticsearch`, `kibana`, `suricata`, etc.

---

#### 5. 🌐 Access Services in Browser (from host/mac)

If you've forwarded ports correctly via **VMware NAT settings**, access:

* **Kibana**: `http://<kali-vm-ip>:5601`
* **Elasticsearch**: `http://<kali-vm-ip>:9200`

> Use `ip a` or `ifconfig` inside the Kali VM to find your NAT-assigned IP (`ens33` interface).

---

#### 6. 🛑 Stop the Stack

When you're done, you can shut everything down with:

```bash
sudo docker-compose down
```

---

Would you like a helper script (`start.sh`, `stop.sh`) to automate this?

# IDS (intrusion detection system(live real time)) / IPS🛰️ #


> IDS = passive system -> sits on the switch and duplicates/mirror ports on switch
> Cannot block traffic - but inspect the traffic
> Traffic doesnt pass through IDS / is parrallel to the traffic
> ONLY Promiscous mode / doesnt have its own ip address and sends packets through analysis tools
> Makes full packet capture + more
> 2 interfaces > monitoring and configuration
> reactive IDS'es with an attack -> it actively sets an alert -> firewalls -> built in gateways that are under attacks and lock down
> Can be dangerous to turn on and automatically lock network and possibly lock down production environemnts
> IDS cannot block current package and can reactively deploy gateway rules to block attack
> Can actively send reset packets to source IP


# IPS ( Intrusion prevention ) #

> serial connection with the network components
> 3 interfaces -> 2 for input/output  - 1 for configuration
> Should be overdimensionded to handle rules -> not firewall rules -> we have 1000 of rules for each packet passing through
> Heavy load on the network
> Looks at the packet -> look for matching rules -> can block the packet
> can also make rules for alarm


## implementation ##

> typically setup rules not to block at initial setup
> scan the traffic and undersstand the traffic of the business
> start ips as ids and then after some time turn on ips features
> often we combine ips and ids -> set of rules for logging traffic if uncertain -> and be sure to block only certain attack
> IDS can helo verify IPS is still operational and error detect ips
> IDS can alert the ips (since ips is further down the network chain)
> We can place a NIDS (network intrusion detection) on the trusted network subnet for detection of attacks from hosts on the edge of the network
> Limit IDS to the most important segments


## TYPES of IDS / IPS ##

## TYPES of IDS / IPS ##

| Type               | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Network-based**  | Network sensors scan traffic that is designated to many hosts               |
| **Host-based**     | Host agent monitors all operations within an operating system               |
| **Signature-based**| Monitors for specific patterns (signatures) that match known threats        |
| **Anomaly-based**  | Flags behavior that deviates from established normal usage patterns         |
| **Hybrid-based**   | Combines multiple detection methods for more accurate threat detection      |


## NETWORK-BASED and Host-Based IPS ##

# 🛡️ NETWORK-BASED vs. HOST-BASED IPS

Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are critical tools in cybersecurity. They actively monitor and analyze traffic to detect and prevent malicious activity in real-time.

---

## 🌐 Network-Based IPS (NIPS)

> **Monitors traffic across the entire network.**

### 🔍 Characteristics:
- Deployed at strategic points (e.g., gateway, firewall).
- Inspects **network packets**.
- Can block **DoS/DDoS** attacks and scanning.
- **Cannot decrypt encrypted payloads** (e.g., TLS, symmetric encryption).

### 🧠 Example Detection:
- Port scans
- SYN floods
- Known exploit signatures

### ❌ Limitation:
```diff
- Cannot see inside encrypted traffic
- Cannot detect host-level malware
````

### 📊 ASCII Diagram:

```
[Internet] ---> [NIPS Firewall] ---> [Internal Network]
                   ||      
            Scans packets 
         Detects network threats
```

---

## 💻 Host-Based IPS (HIPS)

> **Installed directly on endpoint hosts (e.g., servers, laptops).**

### 🔍 Characteristics:

* Analyzes **system-level activity** (files, processes, registry).
* Can **detect encrypted malware** (e.g., ransomware).
* Monitors behavior at **kernel-level**.

### 🧠 Example Detection:

* Code injection (DLL)
* Registry manipulation
* Privilege escalation

### 🔐 Advantage:

```diff
+ Can decrypt and analyze local encrypted activity
+ Detects polymorphic and obfuscated malware
```

### 📊 ASCII Diagram:

## ⚔️ NIPS vs HIPS — Key Differences

| Feature              | NIPS 🌐                   | HIPS 💻                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Deployment Location  | Network perimeter         | Individual host machines           |
| Visibility           | Network traffic           | Host activity                      |
| Encryption Awareness | ❌ Cannot decrypt payloads | ✅ Can analyze decrypted data       |
| Attack Focus         | DDoS, worms, scans        | Malware, exploits, privilege abuse |
| Performance Overhead | Low (network-wide)        | Higher (host CPU/memory)           |

---

## 🎯 Summary:

> 🛡️ **Use both NIPS and HIPS for a layered defense strategy**.

* NIPS provides **broad visibility** and **traffic control**.
* HIPS provides **deep visibility** and **system-level detection**.
* Together, they cover both **external threats** and **internal exploits**.

---

## 🧩 Cybersecurity Expert Insight

* 🔐 **Encrypted traffic (SSL/TLS, symmetric keys)** bypasses NIPS.
* 🧬 **HIPS can catch payloads once decrypted on host memory**.
* 🎭 Malware authors use **encryption + polymorphism** to evade NIPS.

> 💡 Best Practice: Use **SSL decryption** + **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)** in combination with HIPS/NIPS.

___

> NIPS can better detect broad attacks on the network ( DDOS )
> HIPS detect specific host based attacks ( cryptology in malware
> NIPS cannot detect symmmetric key encryption and not decrypt -> NIPS cannot see payload and will not detect BUT host can detectypt on the host

# 🔍 ADVANCED FEATURES OF IDS/IPS SYSTEMS

## 🚧 Resource Constraints in NIPS

> NIPS are often bundled into unified security appliances (e.g., Checkpoint, Fortinet).

### ⚙️ Real-World Constraint:
- Limited CPU/Memory on router+NIPS combo boxes
- Cannot handle high-throughput environments easily
- Performance degrades with **deep packet inspection (DPI)**

---

## 🧬 Signature-Based Detection (IDS/IPS)

> Pattern recognition using known malware fingerprints.

### 📌 How It Works:
- Match traffic or file hash against known **MD5/SHA signatures**
- Example: `e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03` → matches known malware

### ⚠️ Evasion Techniques:
```diff
- Add a space, modify a byte, re-encode → signature breaks
````

#### 🗂️ Example Rule:

```plaintext
Alert if "/etc/shadow" is accessed → trigger signature match
```

---

## 🧾 Policy-Based Detection

> Predefined rules based on organizational policy

### 🧱 Example Use Case:

* ❌ Sales department trying to access Tech segment
* ❌ FTP traffic over HTTP port
* ✅ Trigger alert if segmentation is violated

---

## 📈 Anomaly-Based Detection

> Define "normal," detect the abnormal

### 🧪 Process:

1. Establish a **baseline** (normal traffic patterns)
2. Detect deviation:

   * ❌ Excessive UDP from one host
   * ❌ DHCP-like traffic on non-standard port
   * ❌ ICMP packet with abnormal payload size/content

### ⚠️ Challenges:

* Defining "normal" is **hard**
* Networks are **dynamic**
* High **false positive rate**

---

## 🌐 SYN Flood Example (Anomaly Detection)

* TCP SYN packets flood a target without ACKs
* Sudden spike in half-open connections
* IDS tracks TCP state and alerts on abnormal patterns

---

## 📊 OSI LAYER VISUALIZATION FOR IDS/IPS

```plaintext
+--------------------------+
| Layer 7: Application     | <-- IDS inspects HTTP, FTP, DNS
+--------------------------+
| Layer 6: Presentation    | <-- Limited inspection (e.g., TLS)
+--------------------------+
| Layer 5: Session         | <-- Track stateful sessions
+--------------------------+
| Layer 4: Transport       | <-- Detects SYN floods, port scans
+--------------------------+
| Layer 3: Network         | <-- Inspects IP headers
+--------------------------+
| Layer 2: Data Link       | <-- Rare, but MAC-based filtering
+--------------------------+
| Layer 1: Physical        | ❌ Not inspected by IDS
+--------------------------+
```

| Signature-Based Detection    | ❌                       | ✅                   | ✅                           |
| Anomaly-Based Detection      | ❌                       | ✅                   | ✅                           |
| Real-time Blocking           | ✅                       | ❌ (alert only)      | ✅                           |
| Behavior Learning (Baseline) | ❌                       | ✅                   | ✅                           |
| Encryption Awareness         | ❌ unless SSL inspection | ❌ unless on host    | ❌ unless decrypted upstream |

---

## 🧠 Final Insight:

> **Combining NIPS, HIPS, firewalls, and behavioral analytics = true layered security.**

* Signature-based is **fast but blind to variants**
* Anomaly-based is **powerful but noisy**
* Policy-based ensures **compliance enforcement**
* Each system has **different visibility & control scope**

# 🛡️ Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and IDS/IPS Application Layer Mastery

## 🔍 Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)

> DPI is the ability to inspect not only headers but also the **actual contents (payload)** of packets.

✅ **Main Difference from Firewalls**:
- Firewalls generally operate up to **Layer 4 (Transport Layer)**.
- IDS/IPS can inspect **Layer 7 (Application Layer)** → HTTP, DNS, FTP, SMTP, etc.

### 📦 IDS/IPS Enables:
- Malware detection inside HTTP traffic
- SQL injection payloads
- DNS tunneling detection
- Protocol misuse (e.g., SSH over port 80)

---

## ⚔️ IPS Action Order

> Typical order of operations for an Intrusion Prevention System:

| Action   | Description                                                                 |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pass`   | Allow the traffic through                                                   |
| `drop`   | Silently discard the traffic                                                |
| `reject` | Drop the packet and optionally send TCP RST/ICMP unreachable                |
| `alert`  | Log and notify, **standard for IDS** (does not block traffic)              |

🧠 IDS typically uses:
```plaintext
pass → alert
````

🛡️ IPS typically uses:

```plaintext
pass → alert → drop → reject
```

# 🔐 **Suricata + ELK Stack Integration: Full Packet Capture (FPC) & NIDS Monitoring**

**Audience**: SOC Analysts, Security Engineers, Network Architects  
**Reviewed by**: Cybersecurity Engineering Team  
**Last Updated**: 2025-05-06  

## 🔍 **Objective:**

This guide covers the integration of **Suricata** for **Full Packet Capture (FPC)**, with **Filebeat** as a log shipper, sending network intrusion detection data to an **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** for advanced threat analysis, rule monitoring, and visualization.

### Key Components:
1. **Suricata (NIDS)** - For network intrusion detection and Full Packet Capture (FPC).
2. **Filebeat** - Lightweight shipper that forwards Suricata alerts to ELK.
3. **ELK Stack** - Elasticsearch for storing and querying logs, Logstash for processing logs, and Kibana for visualizing alerts and traffic.
4. **NIDS Light** - Lightweight sensor for generating rules and monitoring intrusion detection data.

---

## 🧩 **Architecture Overview**



### **Workflow:**

1. **Suricata** monitors network traffic, detects intrusions, and performs Full Packet Capture.
2. **Suricata EVE JSON output** (alerts) is forwarded by **Filebeat** to **Logstash** for processing.
3. **Logstash** parses, enriches, and sends logs to **Elasticsearch**.
4. **Kibana** is used to visualize the network traffic, detected intrusions, and the health of the network.

---

## 📦 **Installing Tools and Configuring the Stack**

### 1. **Install Suricata (NIDS)**

Suricata will perform **Full Packet Capture** and generate alerts based on network traffic analysis.

```bash
# Install Suricata on your system (example: Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install suricata
```

**Configuration**:

* Ensure that Suricata is configured to output alerts in **EVE JSON format** (ideal for Filebeat forwarding).

Edit `suricata.yaml` to enable EVE JSON logging:

```yaml
outputs:
  - eve-log:
      enabled: yes
      filetype: json
      filename: /var/log/suricata/eve.json
```

### 2. **Install Filebeat (Log Shipper)**

Filebeat is used to ship logs from Suricata to the ELK stack.

```bash
# Install Filebeat (example: Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install filebeat
```

**Configuration**:
Edit `/etc/filebeat/filebeat.yml` to enable Suricata EVE JSON input:

```yaml
filebeat.inputs:
  - type: log
    enabled: true
    paths:
      - /var/log/suricata/eve.json
    json.keys_under_root: true
    json.add_error_key: true
```

Configure the output to send logs to **Logstash** (which will forward logs to Elasticsearch):

```yaml
output.logstash:
  hosts: ["localhost:5044"]
```

### 3. **Install Logstash (Log Processor)**

Logstash will receive and process Suricata's alerts and forward them to Elasticsearch.

```bash
# Install Logstash (example: Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install logstash
```

**Configuration**:
Create a pipeline to parse the Suricata alerts. In `/etc/logstash/conf.d/suricata-pipeline.conf`, configure the filter and output settings:

```bash
input {
  beats {
    port => 5044
  }
}

filter {
  if [fileset][module] == "suricata" {
    # Suricata-specific filter to decode EVE JSON format
    json {
      source => "message"
      target => "suricata"
    }
  }
}

output {
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["http://localhost:9200"]
    index => "suricata-alerts-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
  }
}
```

### 4. **Install Elasticsearch**

Elasticsearch stores and indexes the processed logs from Suricata.

```bash
# Install Elasticsearch (example: Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install elasticsearch
```

**Start Elasticsearch**:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch
```

### 5. **Install Kibana (Visualization)**

Kibana provides a user-friendly interface to visualize Suricata alerts, monitor traffic, and create dashboards.

```bash
# Install Kibana (example: Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt-get install kibana
```

**Start Kibana**:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable kibana
sudo systemctl start kibana
```
___
Absolutely. Below is a **top professional chapter** written in **Markdown with UX/UI best practices** for inclusion in a **high-end cybersecurity practitioner’s handbook or online reference book**. It focuses on **NIDS Light, Suricata rule writing, testing, and alert generation**, based on your detailed content.

---

# 📖 Chapter 7: NIDS Light & Suricata Rule Crafting Best Practices

**Audience**: Cybersecurity Practitioners, SOC Engineers, Red/Blue Team Operators  
**Scope**: NIDS operation, rule development, alert interpretation, and traffic simulation  
**Stack Focus**: Suricata, Emerging Threats Rules, Fast Logging, Full Packet Capture  
**Prerequisites**: Linux CLI proficiency, packet analysis fundamentals, IDS/IPS concepts  

---

## 🛠️ 1. Verifying Suricata (NIDS Light) Service Status

To confirm if Suricata is operational:

```bash
sudo service suricata status
````

Expected output (example):

```
● suricata.service - LSB: Next generation IDS/IPS
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/suricata)
   Active: active (running)
```

If inactive, start the service:

```bash
sudo service suricata start
```

---

## 🌐 2. Rule Management & Emerging Threats (ET) Sources

Suricata supports two major **open rule feed sources**:

| Rule Set | Type       | Update Frequency  | Access Type       |
| -------- | ---------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| ET Open  | Community  | Delayed (30 days) | Free              |
| ET Pro   | Commercial | Real-time         | Paid Subscription |

Auto-updating can be configured using **`suricata-update`**:

```bash
sudo suricata-update
```

> 🔁 This ensures the latest rules are fetched from your configured provider (ET Open by default).

Rule files are stored in:

```bash
/var/lib/suricata/rules/
```

Custom rules are usually placed in:

```bash
/etc/suricata/rules/local.rules
```

---

## 🧾 3. Anatomy of a Suricata / Snort Rule

```snort
alert tcp any any -> any any (msg: "TCP packet detected"; sid:5000001;)
```

### 🔍 Rule Breakdown:

| Element        | Meaning                                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `alert`        | Action: alert, log, drop, reject                     |
| `tcp`          | Protocol                                             |
| `any any`      | Source IP and source port                            |
| `->`           | Direction of traffic                                 |
| `any any`      | Destination IP and port                              |
| `(msg: "...")` | Message shown in alert logs                          |
| `sid:5000001;` | Unique Signature ID (must not conflict with others!) |

---

## 🎨 4. Visual Rule Breakdown Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[alert] --> B[tcp]
    B --> C[any (src IP)]
    C --> D[any (src port)]
    D --> E[-> direction]
    E --> F[any (dest IP)]
    F --> G[any (dest port)]
    G --> H[msg: "TCP packet detected"]
    H --> I[sid: 5000001]
```

### 📌 Best Practices:

* Use `sid` > **7000000** for custom rules to avoid collisions
* Comment unused rules with `#` to avoid performance impact
* Place custom rules in `local.rules`
* Keep your rules **short, specific**, and **context-aware**

---

## 🏠 5. Preconfigured Variables

Suricata supports **variables** to simplify and modularize rule definitions.

```snort
var HOME_NET [10.0.0.0/8]
var HTTP_PORTS [80,8080,443]
var EXTERNAL_NET !$HOME_NET
```

You can use variables in rules like this:

```snort
alert tcp $EXTERNAL_NET any -> $HOME_NET $HTTP_PORTS (msg:"HTTP attempt"; sid:7000001;)
```

---

## 🧪 6. Testing & Enabling Custom Rules

### 🔬 Step 1: Test Rule Syntax

```bash
sudo suricata -T -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -v
```

### ✅ Step 2: Enable Rule

Restart Suricata to apply the new rule:

```bash
sudo service suricata restart
```

---

## 📁 7. Alerts & Full Packet Capture

### 🔔 Alert Log File

```bash
/var/log/suricata/fast.log
```

### 🧵 To search for a specific alert:

```bash
grep 5000001 /var/log/suricata/fast.log
```

### 💽 Full Packet Capture (.pcap)

Suricata automatically captures packet data in:

```bash
/var/log/suricata/*.pcap
```

Ensure the system is on a **NAT or bridge** mode interface to capture the correct traffic (e.g., `eth0`, `ens33`, `enp0s3`).

---

## 🎇 8. Simulate Traffic (Generate Noise)

Download known malicious traffic to simulate real-world alerts:

1. 📦 Download Sample PCAP:

```bash
wget https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2023/10/31/2023-10-31-icedID-traffic.pcap.zip
unzip 2023-10-31-icedID-traffic.pcap.zip
```

2. 🛠️ Replay with `tcpreplay`:

```bash
sudo tcpreplay -i eth0 -M10 2023-10-31-icedID-infection-traffic.pcap
```

> 📢 This sends the packet stream to the interface, generating alerts that Suricata will log and potentially match rules for.

---

## 🚦 9. Common Pitfalls

| Mistake                         | Solution                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sid` collision                 | Use unique SID values > 7000000                                         |
| Rules not firing                | Check direction, port, and protocol accuracy                            |
| Interface not capturing traffic | Ensure NIC is in **promiscuous** mode (`ip link set eth0 promisc on`)   |
| Overloaded system               | Disable unused rules (`# comment`) or apply rule thresholds             |
| IDS not seeing ARP              | IDS systems typically don’t parse L2 ARP packets – consider switch logs |

---

## John The ripper cracking password: mAgwyv-zaxdem-6nunvu ##

> Cracking mAgwyv-zaxdem-6nunvu will take significant longer time.
> This password has been created using MacOs password manager.

Certainly! Below is a markdown chapter that explains this type of password `mAgwyv-zaxdem-6nunvu` based on common patterns found in password creation and security analysis.

# Chapter: Understanding Complex Password Patterns

## 1. Introduction to Complex Passwords

Complex passwords are designed to increase security by making it more difficult for attackers to guess or crack them using brute force or dictionary-based attacks. The password `mAgwyv-zaxdem-6nunvu` is a typical example of a complex password that incorporates a mix of different character types and structures.

In this chapter, we will break down the components of this password and discuss why this type of structure is more secure compared to simpler passwords.

---

## 2. Breaking Down the Structure

The password `mAgwyv-zaxdem-6nunvu` follows a specific structure, which includes:

### 2.1 Mixed Case Letters

* **mAgwyv** and **zaxdem** contain both uppercase and lowercase letters.
* Using a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters makes a password harder to guess because it increases the potential number of character combinations for each position.

  * For example, a lowercase letter has 26 possibilities, while an uppercase letter also has 26 possibilities. Combining both increases the strength of the password exponentially.

### 2.2 Hyphen as a Separator

* The hyphen `-` used between `mAgwyv` and `zaxdem`, and again between `zaxdem` and `6nunvu`, can act as a delimiter to visually separate different sections of the password.
* While separators like hyphens don't directly increase the entropy (randomness) of a password, they can make it easier for a user to remember complex passwords by breaking them into recognizable chunks.

  However, note that a hyphen might not significantly impact password strength from a technical standpoint unless combined with other unique characters.

### 2.3 Numbers

* The inclusion of the digit `6` in `6nunvu` adds another layer of complexity. Numbers are essential in making passwords more robust. Without them, a password would only consist of 26 lowercase and 26 uppercase letters, significantly reducing the number of possible combinations.

  * When numbers are used along with letters, the character set grows, improving password security.

### 2.4 Length of the Password

* The length of `mAgwyv-zaxdem-6nunvu` is 21 characters, which is relatively long for a password. Longer passwords exponentially increase the number of possible combinations. For example, if each character had 62 possible choices (26 lowercase letters, 26 uppercase letters, and 10 digits), a 21-character password would have $62^{21}$ possible combinations, making it much harder to crack.

---

## 3. Security Considerations

### 3.1 Entropy

The strength of a password depends heavily on its entropy, which refers to the unpredictability or randomness of the password.

* **Entropy Formula**: Entropy can be calculated based on the number of characters in the password and the size of the character set used. For example:

  * Lowercase letters: 26 characters
  * Uppercase letters: 26 characters
  * Digits: 10 characters
  * Special characters (if applicable): typically around 32 characters

Given that `mAgwyv-zaxdem-6nunvu` uses a combination of these elements, its entropy is considerably higher than a password consisting of only lowercase letters or a common word.

### 3.2 Brute Force Resistance

The password is resistant to **brute force attacks**, where an attacker attempts every possible combination to guess the password. A brute force attack is typically more feasible for short, simple passwords.

* **Brute Force Example**: If an attacker tries all combinations of characters, the length and diversity of the character set in `mAgwyv-zaxdem-6nunvu` make such an attack computationally expensive and time-consuming.

### 3.3 Dictionary and Rainbow Table Attacks

* While `mAgwyv-zaxdem-6nunvu` may appear to be a random string, it does not seem to contain easily guessable words or common phrases, which reduces the risk of **dictionary attacks**.
* A **rainbow table attack** uses precomputed hashes for common passwords. Since the password in question includes a mix of characters and numbers, it is more likely to be resistant to such attacks, especially if the password hash uses a strong encryption algorithm.

---

## 4. Tips for Creating Strong Passwords

To create a password similar to `mAgwyv-zaxdem-6nunvu`, consider the following best practices:

### 4.1 Use a Combination of Character Types

* Use **uppercase** and **lowercase** letters.
* Include **numbers** to increase entropy.
* Use **special characters** like `@`, `#`, `-`, etc. to further complicate the password.

### 4.2 Avoid Common Patterns

* Avoid easily guessable combinations such as `"password123"`, `"admin"`, or simple keyboard patterns like `"qwerty"`.

### 4.3 Keep the Password Length Long

* Longer passwords are generally stronger. Aim for passwords that are at least **16-20 characters** in length.

### 4.4 Consider Password Managers

* Using a password manager to store complex passwords is an excellent way to avoid forgetting them, especially when you are required to use long and random passwords for different accounts.

---

## 5. Conclusion

The password `mAgwyv-zaxdem-6nunvu` is a good example of a strong, complex password that incorporates multiple character types and a reasonable length. By understanding the structure and strength of passwords like this, you can create better, more secure passwords for your online accounts.

Always remember to consider entropy, length, and diversity when creating passwords, and ensure that you’re using tools like password managers to help manage them securely.

```

It looks like the password cracking attempt did not succeed, as indicated by the output message:

```
0g 0:01:17:43 DONE (2025-05-12 06:12) 0g/s 214.4p/s 214.4c/s 214.4C/s vjhy1htzs..vjht008
Session completed.
```

This shows that the tool didn't crack any passwords ("0g" means zero good passwords found) in the specified time. The process was completed, but no matches were found with the given wordlist (`10-million-passwords.txt`) for the hashed passwords in `/etc/unshadow.txt`.

If you suspect the hash might be complex or if the wordlist is insufficient, you could try:

1. **Using a larger or more targeted wordlist**.
2. **Trying a different attack method**, such as a dictionary-based attack with more sophisticated rules or a brute-force attack (though this could take a very long time).
3. **Using a different hash-cracking tool or technique**, depending on the hash type.

Let me know if you need further assistance with this!

Firwalls implemented on each host system via iptables are a very cost effective way to control and filter out unwanted traffic.

Not only implementing packet filtering mechanism in a network architecture through Firewalls implemented on the communication lines, but also on each host machine system will allow for more secure means of communication.

This also adheares to principle of [defence in depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_(computing)). [Military  Defenc in depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_in_depth)

## Chains ##

Set a chain with a purpose: 
We can insert subchains in the iptables main 3 chains  INPUT, FORWARD, OUTPUT.



___

Server with economic system and database (seperated). 
Can protect databases from remote access.
Granular access

___

Ensure to boot with execute IP rules for saving rules with shutdown and apply rules when boot.

USE VERBOSE 
```bash
sudo iptables -L -v
```

> alice@alice: /etc/netplan$
```bash
sudo iptables -S
```
>-P INPUT ACCEPT
>-P FORWARD ACCEPT
>-P OUTPUT ACCEPT


```bash

___

Append rule at the end of chain:
```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
```

| -m = module (can help about what happend prior to packet (n) | conntrack (list of standard services that uses more than one port)  (stateful inspection) | -- ctstate | ESTABLISHED,RELATED (BASED ON 3-way handshake) Packets not established from inside are dropped, i allow responses from the established connection from internal host RELATED = if protocol uses more n>1 more than 1 protocols for the service | j = jump | ACCEPT / DROP|

Allow anywhere tcp 
```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p TCP --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
```
Allow only specific ip address:
```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p TCP --dport 22 --source 192.168.249.1/24 -j ACCEPT
```
Delete chain rule 2
```bash
sudo iptables -D INPUT 2
```

For redundany:
LOOPBACK important for services performance (most packets must be first in the chain for performance tuning)
```bash

## Authentication ## 

Password [HIVE: Brute Force table risk](https://www.hivesystems.com/blog/are-your-passwords-in-the-green)

Read NIST's view on [authenticators](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3-Implementation-Resources/63B/Authenticators/) 

Shared secret ( we know something mutaual) 

Imaging a battlefield -> if soldiers have to pass they should know the mutual shared secret to not be shot down if approcing friendly lines back from scouting. 

In todays digital world this is a bit problematic. 

Why is this not suitable:

- this is something we know and this is easy to steal or guess

Other options? 

- something we have is better

Back in the days, we could rip off a dollar ticket and the two pieces will onyl match and this can verify and authenticate.

We categories this as another methode of verification:
- This is more unique and authenticate
- But will be more costly to implement than a password (or something we know)


Biometric authentication: 
- This is another methode of verification


## [Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication) depends on the weakes link ## 


3 methodes:
        - What you know (passwords)
        - What you have(dongle, smartcard, certficate, phone,...)
        - What you are(biometrics, height, voice, walk dynamics,...)


Danish solution *NemID* (outfaced)
An authentication methode implemented often via keys on a physical card with 50 keys.
        - Implementation : you get a number and must find the correspending key on the physical card. 
🔺RISKS : 
        - People take pictures of the physical card and coudl share it.
        
Other solutions to keys:
        - With a dongle 


CURRENT danish authentication:
        - app on phone

## Weakness of passwords ##

**Password reuse**
**Writing down passwords**
**Weak system in password creation** 

For fun only:
[Statistics on passwords](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/password-stats)
___

## Educate users when setting up passwords  ##

- Tell the user if it is to easy to implement the password
- Check and compare reuse of passwords from databases

___

Middleware Software also default passwords
- Databases ( MySQL, LDAP, MS, Oracle,...) Web servers, Web shop templates.
- CRM, economic system

## PROCEDURE Checklist: 

- Check password
- Delete original admin account
- document admin account credentials (for all systems all devices)
- ask people for passwords (what are your passwords)
- research passwords on social media ( Men chooses : hobbies, football clubs | Women : Chooses emotional topics, family names, interests)
- try online guessing
- hashes brute forcing / download hashes and bruteforce passwords
- Do not store passwords in clear text
- use ***[key derevative](https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/Projects/crypto-publication-review-project/documents/initial-comments/sp800-132-initial-public-comments-2023.pdf)*** hashing functions like Argon2 also look at my [explenation of hashing](https://orskoven.github.io/orskov.github.io/#use-key-derivative-functions-for-password-storage)
- use salt and peber ( user database is salt and password (then you save peber someware else))

### Practical password ###

🖥️ on linux let's look at the password hashing storing in linux ubuntu system.
Hashes and plaintext are stored seperately for permission granularity. 

```bash
john:$y$salt$hash
```
| $ | Seperator | 
| salt | before hash value / makes rainbowtable useless (will cost the attacker on CPU or and TIME) | 

```bash
cat /etc/passwd
```
```bash
cat /etc/shadow
```
___



Accessing the data maliciosly 

**Remeber to encrypt disk** 

Scenario : 
> BOOT with your own disk inserted to a host (extenal usb)
> The system should open with permission for the usb inserted.  
> Next: the attack should overwrite the /etc/passwd file

This would occur to user:
> if password is not corretly written in login
> user will be prompted and cause is the attacker in scenario before

___

### GUIDE : ###
🔺 Only with physical access and non encrypted disk 🔺 

Booting with permission and priviliges to external usb inserted

Imagine BOB (current admin)  ALICE(hacker)


```bash
sudo adduser alice
```
```bash
password123
```
Enter Information 
and access hashed password file:
```bash
sudo cat /etc/shadow 
```
in editing mode in the file 
swap two password hashes
(for learning: you should know both passwords) 
now with the hash swap you can login in with the other users password.

### Password Defence ### 

Strong password policy🔺
- opensource compiled manager - research / sandbox / compile yourself
- require longer passwords
- require uppercase lowercase numbers special characters
- limit password validity 60 or 90 days
- consuder system generated passwords
- use some password manager
- periodic cracking of company users passwords for "simple passwords"
- no reuse of userid & password across service
- add location and time limitations for login
- add second or third factor of authentication

### The Stack ###

ELK stack 

### Elasticsearch ###

Ensure to link data and correlate data.
No need for data preparation manually. 

### Kibana ###
UI for graphical presentation of the data.

### Beats ### 
Ingest from different systems. 
We can install beats on hosts to pick up and sensor logs from multiple hosts into the ELK stack.

Logstash 
Kibana
Beats 
and others 

Centralized logs 

Helps centralize between example: 

Web servers - Admin servers - Redundant databases - Application Servers

Major outages avoid, since elastic stack is centralized logs. 

Kibana is visualisation of the logs.

Can search logs for it security issues. 

Not like Splunk. 

Core components opensource and free

end point security monitoring self host stack


### BEATS ###

Light weight way to ship logs into the stack
written in go:

Filebeat 
Packetbeat 
+ more

Logstash transform incoming data.
Beats single purpose tool. 

Logstash is more resource intensive.


Elasticsearch 

holds index of data 
holds all data itself

in production is deployed in a cluster 
with shards a b c 
redundant copies in clusters like kubernetes 


### KIBANA ### 

Web frontend, define preset dashboard for birdseye view. 


### Setup ###

VM 
Vagrant

## Arp Spoofing ##

Installing arpspoof for linux.
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install dsniff
```
> Make linux act as a "router" (man in the middle).
Remove '#' commented line with the text: “net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1”.
/etc/sysctl.conf
```bash
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
```
Reconfigure the kernel parameters at runtime to apply the change.
```bash
sudo sysctl -p
```

On victim ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt install net-tools
```
Check arp table. 
```bash
sudo arp -a
```

🔻On both attacker and victim terminals.

🔺 Adjust ip addresses acordingly: 

> in my setup: Attacker IP: 172.16.196.132 | Victim IP: 172.16.196.133
> 
```bash
sudo arpspoof -i eth0 -t 172.16.196.133 172.16.196.132
```
```bash
sudo arpspoof -i eth0 -t 172.16.196.132 172.16.196.133
```

Check the ARP table again to verify that the victim ip address has been removed when arp spoofing.
```bash
sudo arp -a
```

> In my case it all i one terminal so i will use '&' to allow multiple commands running simulatniously:

```bash
sudo arpspoof -i eth0 -t 172.16.196.132 172.16.196.133 & sudo arpspoof -i eth0 -t 172.16.196.133 172.16.196.132 & sudo arp -a

## 🕸️Virutal Private Networking (VPN)🕸️ ## 

Devices are typically protected on a local network, because of local ip address space not being defualt routable across the internet.

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) can be setup to securely connect and access resources on a reomte local ip address space and make resources securely availbale through network tunneling protocols, not requiring connected hosts to be on the same local ip network.

Encryption is vital to the security of the VPN when the VPN is accessed through insecure communication lines (the public internet).

Provider-provisioned VPN is isolating the provider's own network infrastruture in virtual segments. 
This allows for making segements private to other segements in the network. 
This can be implemented with weak or no security feautures 

[VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network)
Sources for the following content origins from Scott Simpsons course on linkedin learning [Learning VPN](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-vpn/how-vpn-works?resume=false&u=36836804)
___

### Routing ###

Routes determines how packets flow to different networks.
A **Layer 3 VPN** creates a new route for a virtual network adapter

### Bridging ###

**Layer 2** VPNs behave like devices that are on the same physical network.

### Encapsulation ###

Information is wrapped inside of packets that can travel between networks.
Local traffic is encapsulated to travel between client and server.

___

## Layer 2 (data link layer)💌 ##

Transmission of frames between devices
Bridged VPN 
Layer 2 virtual devices are called TAP (tap0,tap1) 


## Layer 3 (network layer)🛤️ ##

Transmission of packets (IP)
Routed VPN
Layer 3 virutal devices are called TUN (tun0, tun1)

## PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) (Layer 2) ##

Sets up a connection between two hosts 
Creates a connection between two hosts with a virtual network adapter at each end
ISP used to crete a network link over media-like phones lines to carry ehternet frames between IP networks
Used in DSL Modems and most VPN protocols

## Key Exchange🗝️<->🗝️ ##

VPN peers exchange encryption information to establish a secure connection.

Some protocols rely on a PSK (pre-shared key) and others agree on what security keys to use when a connection is started. 

Negotiate back and forth to agress on a key exchange before setting up a secure channel.


## Forward Security🔐 ##

Also called "Perfect Forward Security".

New session keys are generated for each session used to encrypt and decrypt the data.

Prevents malicious reuse of keys for future sessions. (Go to the hybrid encryption section)

🔺 RISK : be sure to use secure and not broken protocols 🔺

## Ports🛳️ ##

Ports used by VPN protocls are the ports on the server.

Clients choose a local port to connect from.

Ports need to be opened on the server's firewall and on the any firewalls between it and the internet. 

___

## 🔺PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol🔺 ###

🔺 Considered obsolete because most of the ciphers it uses are easily broken🔺

🔺Top out on 128 bit encryption🔺

🔺Uses **TCP port 1723** to set up a **GRE tunnel**, through which a PPP connection **(Protocol 47)** transfers encrypted packets.🔺

🔺Most routers pass PPTP traffic without a problem. 🔺

___

## L2TP/IPsec ##

Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol over IPsec (IP security)

IPsec creates a secure channel through which an L2TP tunnel transfers data.

# [L2TP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_2_Tunneling_Protocol) #
Encapsulates Layer 2 traffic to travel over Layer 3 (IP) (normally not possible)
Allows Ethernet Bridging over the internet
No security

# [IPsec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec) #
Creates a secure connection
Only carries IP traffic

## Making an [L2TP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_2_Tunneling_Protocol)/[IPsec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec) Connection ##

IPsec uses IKE (Internet Key Exchange) via UDP port 500 to negotiate a Security Association (SA) 

UDP port 4500 for NAT traversal mode

SA sets up ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload; protocol 50) to encrypt packets.

L2TP tunnel is established through TCP port 1701, to pass traffic protected with ESP

PPP establishes virtual network interface with IP addresses at each end.

👱‍♀️
Uses user authentication and machine-level shared secret or certificate
may need group name based on system admin setup.

✔️ Good choice for security and is widely available

Useful if you need to transfer Layer 2 data instead of just Layer 3 data.

# IKEv2 #
Internet Key Exchange, version 2

IKEv2 manages the SA for an IPsec connection

Uses UDP port 500 and UDP port 4500 for NAT traversal (supports 256 bit encryption) 

IPsec provides Layer 3 connectivity (IP)

💲MOBIKE feature provides quick reconnection - great for mobile devices📴💲

Uses user authentication, shared secret or certificate and a remote ID

___

## [OpenVPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVPN) ##

Open-source software and protocol.

Uses OpenSSL library to handle key exchange via **SSL/TLS** (offers 256 bit encryption) 

Creates a Layer 2 or Layer 3 connection. 

Via custom security protocol based on TLS. 

Uses TCP port 1194 by default, can be changed to other UDP/TCP ports. 

Works well through NAT and proxies.

✔️✔️ Widely recommended


___
### Other Protocols ###

## [Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Socket_Tunneling_Protocol) ##

Creates a secure channel using **SSL/TLS**

Uses **TCP port 443**

Fairly wide support 

Creates a client-network connection

## 🚦TRANSFERING A FILE SECURELY WITH SCP AND SFTP🗃️🔐🚦 ##

Transferring files should be confidentially encrypted to secure zero tampering while in transit.
FTP <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">[File Transfer Protoco]</a>  was not concieved with proper encryption, hence SFTP is prefered.

In this guide i propose two different commandline linux solutions for encrypted file transfer, SFTP (recommended) and SCP (outdated / not-recommended). 

We are using scp even if it is outdated, for learning purposes.
___
### TOOLS USED ###

| Command | Description | Link | OS |
|  ---    | ---         | ---   | --- |
| (not-recommended)  ```scp``` | Uses SSH for secure copy (outdated)| <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy_protocol">[Secure Copy Protocol]</a> | linux |
| ```fstp``` | Uses secure channel (like SSH) for file transfering | <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol">[SSH File Transfer Protocol]</a> | linux |
| ```cp``` | copy file protocol | <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cp_(Unix)">[Copy Protocol]</a> | linux |
| (not safe)```ftp``` |file transfer protocol | <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">[File Transfer Protoco]</a> | linux |
___

### Requirements ###

Two (linux) host machines either being local🏚️ or remote🌥️ (doesn't make a difference).

[i run two seperate hosts on vmware (community/free) locally]
 
**[IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) addresses (IP addresses)** of the two machines🖥️ running linux (preferrable ubuntu servers).

You can find the ip address with ```ifconfig``` look at eth0 and inet.

or 

use ```ip a``` and look for inet.
Basic knowledge of bash command line scripting and perhaps (networking).
___
#### !NETWORK SETUP! ####

On both hosts add a user1 or use another user to send recieve files.

Create a user named "user1"
```bash
adduser user1
```
switch user to "user1"
```bash
su - user1
```
___
### CODE IMPLEMENTATION ###


#### FILE TRASNFER USING SCP(outdated) ####

ON SENDING HOST
```cd``` into the /home/user1 directory
create a file using ```nano``` 
```bash
cd /home/user1
 ```
create a file using ```nano``` 
```bash
nano file.txt
 ```
add some txt
```txt
hello world
```

(not-recommended) use scp to transfer the file.txt
```bash
scp file.txt user1@<ip address>:/home/user1
```
[in my local setup] i use ipv4 address: ```172.16.196.134``` for the recieving server
```bash
scp file.txt user1@$172.16.196.134:/home/user1
```

#### Verify the result on the recieving server ####

ON RECIEVING HOST

```bash
su - user1
```
```bash
cd /home/user1/
```
check if the file.txt appears
```bash
ls 
```
```bash
nano file.txt
```

If the text matches ```hello world```, congratulations you are done✔️.

## Kerboros (protocol) 🦮🦮🦮
[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/npNXXRAvMpU/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npNXXRAvMpU&t=524s)
AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM | CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT | SINGLE SIGN ON (SSO)

Preventing potential threat actors from sniffing any enterprise confidential information can be handle with Kerberos, while maintaining high availability to critical to employee resources.

**[Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/)**  a network authentication protocol [Free], offers usability through it's Ticket Granting System/Ticket based authentication. It uses [symmetric-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol)) and requires a trusted third party and optionally may use public-key cryptography during certain phases of communication.

Uses UDP port 88 as default.


### Kerberos from the inside

 Use Case: End user wishes to gain access to a service supporting Kerberos (Kerberized Service).

 1. End User🖥️ uses **Kerberos client** on their system with *username* & *password*
 2. **Kerberos client** creates *authentication request* in clear text to **authentication server**
 3. **Authentication server** looks up *user* in its *database* and retrieves user's *password*
 4. **Authentication server** sends two messages back to client:
    1. **TGS session key** randomly generated session key for **Kerberos Client** and **Ticket Granting Server** [Message is encrypted using the clients *password*].
    2. **Ticket Granting Ticket** includes information about the **Kerberos Client** and a copy of the client's **TGS session key**.
   Message is encrypted with a key only known to the **ticket-granting server**.
 5. **Kerberos Client** recieves the messages:
    1. Decrypts message using the user's *password*.
    2. This provides access to the **TGS session key** [without correct password, you wont get further].

## 🚦IMPLEMENTING KERBEROS🚦 ##

#### KERBEROS SERVER / Key Distribution Center (KDC) 🏰 ####



Open the hosts file.
```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```
add
```txt
127.0.0.1 kdc.example.com
```
to the following to the ip address list so it looks something like this:
```txt
127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.1.1 ldap
127.0.0.1 kdc.example.com
```

save the file and start installing.
```bash
sudo apt get update
sudo apt install krb5-kdc krb5-admin-server
``` 
Default Kerberos version 5 realm (realm needs to be capital letters):
```txt
EXAMPLE.COM
``` 
Kerberos servers for your realm:
 ```txt
kdc.example.com
```
 Administrative server for your Kerberos realm:      
 ```txt
kdc.example.com
```
**🛑🔐!! PROCTECT THE MASTER KEY !!🔐🛑**
to create the example.com realm run the following command
and you will be prompted to enter a master key, which is very important to store in safe manner.
```bash
sudo krb5_newrealm
```
add a user to manage centrally
```bash
sudo kadmin.local 
```
add a principal, this is what user and services are called 
```bash
addprinc simon 
```
enter a password twice and write 'exit to exit
```bash
exit
```

  edit /etc/krb5.conf file & add the following lines in [domain_realm] section
```txt
.kdc.com = kdc.example.com
kdc.com = kdc.example.com
```

#### CLIENT 🖥️ ####

```bash
sudo apt get update
sudo apt install krb5-user krb5-config
```
create a file called etc krb5.conf
```bash
dpkg-reconfigure krb5-config
```
Default Kerberos version 5 realm:
```txt
EXAMPLE.COM
```
look at the krb5.conf file and configure (based on your setup perhaps automation tools)
```bash
cat /etc/krb5.confl
```
we will edit /etc/krb5.conf file & add the following lines in [domain_realm] section
```txt
.example.com = kdc.example.com
example.com = kdc.example.com
```

**check if we can communicate with the Kerberos server /KDC** 

```bash
kinit -p simon@EXAMPLE.COM
```
list the details of the ticket with
```bash
klist
```
**Client is ready to request Ticket Granting Server**

## Configuring the system access 
We need to configure access on the system that corresponds to the Kerberos Principle.
Add a user simon
```bash
adduser simon
```
in order to let someone log in, the system needs an account for them to use.
Kerberos should handle the authentication/password and the activation of the user's account on that machine. The kerberos user will map onto the local user when they log in.
[PAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_PAM) support is added for our Kerberized user:
```bash
sudo apt install libpam-krb5.
```
see and control the inclusion of Kerboros in the PAM files:
```bash
grep krb /etc/pam.d/*
```
**Log in as Kerberized user**

Sign in again to the host/virtual machine, switch to a new console.
After signing in use:
```bash
klist
```
verify you get information about the Kerberos Ticket:
```bash

```
#### PROTECTED SERVER 📭 ####

```bash
sudo apt install krb5 config
```

Edit ***/etc/ssh/sshd_config***

add ***yes*** to following lines:

```txt
GSSAPIAuthentication yes
GSSAPICleanupCredentials yes
```

```bash
restart!!!
```

### KERBEROS SERVER 🏰 ###

  add the ssh server to the kerberos management
  add principal 
  creat a key file
```bash
ktadd  k /tmp/sshserver.kea.dk.keytab
host/sshserver.kea.dk
```
  copy the keyfile to the ssh server /etc directory

```bash
```

### CLIENT 🖥️ ###

  get the ticket from the kerberos server
```bash
kinit root/admin
klist  A 
```


### SUMMARY OF SETUP ###

  install both kerberos server packages on kerboros server
  install kerberos client package
    add get a a ticket for the user that will login remotely
  on ssh server [protected server] 
    install krb5

## 📖 CRYPTOLOGY: HASHING WEAKNESS


Sources:
<p>  <a href="https://www.rfc editor.org/rfc/rfc8554.html">RFC 8554 </a> </p>

<p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function"> wikipedia. </a></p>

### 3 Weaknesses of Hashing ###



The hashing function must be deterministic in it's output given an input of arbritary size. 
This is the way hashing is used to encode data for more effcient memory utilization.

This is useful, but not the primer goal of hashing in cryptography.

While providing the effectiveness of hashing algorithm's ability to obfuscate information, like password storage in databases, many algorithms have proven to be weak to certain types of attacks.

Therefore, as always, we must carefully research and evalutate any security methodes, before bringing them to production environment.
According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function"> wikipedia <a> the following conditions are met in a secure hash function and it's corresponding output, such as SHA 3 and Argon2.

```
Pre image resistance
Given a hash value h, it should be difficult to find any message m such that h = hash(m). This concept is related to that of a one way function. Functions that lack this property are vulnerable to preimage attacks.
```
```
Second pre image resistance
Given an input m1, it should be difficult to find a different input m2 such that hash(m1) = hash(m2). This property is sometimes referred to as weak collision resistance. Functions that lack this property are vulnerable to second preimage attacks.
```
```
Collision resistance
It should be difficult to find two different messages m1 and m2 such that hash(m1) = hash(m2). Such a pair is called a cryptographic hash collision. This property is sometimes referred to as strong collision resistance. It requires a hash value at least twice as long as that required for pre image resistance; otherwise, collisions may be found by a birthday attack.
```

Attack vectors against hashes (output of the hash functions) count, birthday attacks, preimage attack, second preimage attack.

#### Security / Computational Speed Tradeoff ###

| HASH FUNCTION | SECURITY | SPEED 
| ------        | ------- |  ----- |
| SHA 1         | NOT SECURE | FAST |
| SHA 2         | HIGH    | FAST |
| SHA 3         |  HIGHEST | FAST |
| Argon2         | HIGEHST | SLOW | 
| SHA 256         | HIGH | FAST |
| SHA 512         | VERY HIGH | FAST | 

#### Tools used: ####


| Name | Description | OS |
| ---     | ---            | --   |
| hash identifier | Identifies hash function algorithm based on an output/digest | Linux | 
| <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#input=SGVsbG8gd29ybGQ">Cyber Chef </a> | Online tool for calculating outputs/digests with all major cryptology algorithms | webbrowser |
| John The Ripper | Password cracking tool | Linux |
| Hash Cat | | Linux |




#### Birthday attack ####

Relates to the property, collision resistance. Given the output value, it should be extremely hard to calculate another input value. 

In the case of SHA 256, the security from birthday attacks is given by the 50% of hashing the same output given two distinct hash inputs.

SHA 256 algorithm output birthday attack security level is 2^(256/2) = 2^128 different inputs needed to collide with an existing hash output.

The security level against brithday attacks withing the SHA 1 algorithm output of 160 bits (not secure) is 2^(160/2) = 2^80 different inputs needed to collide with an existing hash output hashed with the same algorithm (SHA 1 of 160 bits).

#### Use Key Derivative Functions for password storage ####

Attackers can download a database of hashed password and attempt to crack the password by comparing salts from already known passwords, and thereby obtain access to matching passwords accounts.

Salting can to some extend prevent attackers success by adding an extra entry/element together with the hashed password. 

***Best practice*** is to couple salting with a Key Derivative Function.

***KDF's, take a key, salt, iterations as inputs.***
The goal is to slow down the process of attempts to bruteforce or use dictionary attakcs to obtain the password or passphrase of a victim.

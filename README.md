___

## SOF-ELK ##

Elsatic Stack -> SOF ELK 


### The Stack ###

ELK stack 

Elasticsearch 

Logstash 
Kibana
Beats 
and others 

Centralized logs 

Helps centralize between example: 

Web servers - Admin servers - Redundant databases - Application Servers

Major outages avoid, since elastic stack is centralized logs. 

Kibana is visualisation of the logs.

Can search logs for it security issues. 

Not like Splunk. 

Core components opensource and free

end point security monitoring self host stack


### BEATS ###

Light weight way to ship logs into the stack
written in go:

Filebeat 
Packetbeat 
+ more

Logstash transform incoming data.
Beats single purpose tool. 

Logstash is more resource intensive.


Elasticsearch 

holds index of data 
holds all data itself

in production is deployed in a cluster 
with shards a b c 
redundant copies in clusters like kubernetes 


### KIBANA ### 

Web frontend, define preset dashboard for birdseye view. 


### Setup ###

VM 
Vagrant

## Arp Spoofing ##

Installing arpspoof for linux.
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```
```bash
sudo apt-get install dsniff
```
> Make linux act as a "router" (man in the middle).
Remove '#' commented line with the text: ‚Äúnet.ipv4.ip_forward = 1‚Äù.
/etc/sysctl.conf
```bash
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
```
Reconfigure the kernel parameters at runtime to apply the change.
```bash
sudo sysctl -p
```

On victim ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt install net-tools
```
Check arp table. 
```bash
sudo arp -a
```

üîªOn both attacker and victim terminals.

üî∫ Adjust ip addresses acordingly: 

> in my setup: Attacker IP: 172.16.196.132 | Victim IP: 172.16.196.133
> 
```bash
sudo arpspoof -i eth0 -t 172.16.196.133 172.16.196.132
```
```bash
sudo arpspoof -i eth0 -t 172.16.196.132 172.16.196.133
```

Check the ARP table again to verify that the victim ip address has been removed when arp spoofing.
```bash
sudo arp -a
```

> In my case it all i one terminal so i will use '&' to allow multiple commands running simulatniously:

```bash
sudo arpspoof -i eth0 -t 172.16.196.132 172.16.196.133 & sudo arpspoof -i eth0 -t 172.16.196.133 172.16.196.132 & sudo arp -a
```

## üï∏Ô∏èVirutal Private Networking (VPN)üï∏Ô∏è ## 

Devices are typically protected on a local network, because of local ip address space not being defualt routable across the internet.

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) can be setup to securely connect and access resources on a reomte local ip address space and make resources securely availbale through network tunneling protocols, not requiring connected hosts to be on the same local ip network.

Encryption is vital to the security of the VPN when the VPN is accessed through insecure communication lines (the public internet).

Provider-provisioned VPN is isolating the provider's own network infrastruture in virtual segments. 
This allows for making segements private to other segements in the network. 
This can be implemented with weak or no security feautures 

[VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network)
Sources for the following content origins from Scott Simpsons course on linkedin learning [Learning VPN](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-vpn/how-vpn-works?resume=false&u=36836804)
___

### Routing ###

Routes determines how packets flow to different networks.
A **Layer 3 VPN** creates a new route for a virtual network adapter

### Bridging ###

**Layer 2** VPNs behave like devices that are on the same physical network.

### Encapsulation ###

Information is wrapped inside of packets that can travel between networks.
Local traffic is encapsulated to travel between client and server.

___

## Layer 2 (data link layer)üíå ##

Transmission of frames between devices
Bridged VPN 
Layer 2 virtual devices are called TAP (tap0,tap1) 


## Layer 3 (network layer)üõ§Ô∏è ##

Transmission of packets (IP)
Routed VPN
Layer 3 virutal devices are called TUN (tun0, tun1)

## PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) (Layer 2) ##

Sets up a connection between two hosts 
Creates a connection between two hosts with a virtual network adapter at each end
ISP used to crete a network link over media-like phones lines to carry ehternet frames between IP networks
Used in DSL Modems and most VPN protocols

## Key ExchangeüóùÔ∏è<->üóùÔ∏è ##

VPN peers exchange encryption information to establish a secure connection.

Some protocols rely on a PSK (pre-shared key) and others agree on what security keys to use when a connection is started. 

Negotiate back and forth to agress on a key exchange before setting up a secure channel.


## Forward Securityüîê ##

Also called "Perfect Forward Security".

New session keys are generated for each session used to encrypt and decrypt the data.

Prevents malicious reuse of keys for future sessions. (Go to the hybrid encryption section)

üî∫ RISK : be sure to use secure and not broken protocols üî∫

## Portsüõ≥Ô∏è ##

Ports used by VPN protocls are the ports on the server.

Clients choose a local port to connect from.

Ports need to be opened on the server's firewall and on the any firewalls between it and the internet. 

___

## üî∫PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocolüî∫ ###

üî∫ Considered obsolete because most of the ciphers it uses are easily brokenüî∫

üî∫Top out on 128 bit encryptionüî∫

üî∫Uses **TCP port 1723** to set up a **GRE tunnel**, through which a PPP connection **(Protocol 47)** transfers encrypted packets.üî∫

üî∫Most routers pass PPTP traffic without a problem. üî∫

___

## L2TP/IPsec ##

Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol over IPsec (IP security)

IPsec creates a secure channel through which an L2TP tunnel transfers data.

# [L2TP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_2_Tunneling_Protocol) #
Encapsulates Layer 2 traffic to travel over Layer 3 (IP) (normally not possible)
Allows Ethernet Bridging over the internet
No security

# [IPsec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec) #
Creates a secure connection
Only carries IP traffic

## Making an [L2TP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_2_Tunneling_Protocol)/[IPsec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec) Connection ##

IPsec uses IKE (Internet Key Exchange) via UDP port 500 to negotiate a Security Association (SA) 

UDP port 4500 for NAT traversal mode

SA sets up ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload; protocol 50) to encrypt packets.

L2TP tunnel is established through TCP port 1701, to pass traffic protected with ESP

PPP establishes virtual network interface with IP addresses at each end.

üë±‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Uses user authentication and machine-level shared secret or certificate
may need group name based on system admin setup.

‚úîÔ∏è Good choice for security and is widely available

Useful if you need to transfer Layer 2 data instead of just Layer 3 data.

# IKEv2 #
Internet Key Exchange, version 2

IKEv2 manages the SA for an IPsec connection

Uses UDP port 500 and UDP port 4500 for NAT traversal (supports 256 bit encryption) 

IPsec provides Layer 3 connectivity (IP)

üí≤MOBIKE feature provides quick reconnection - great for mobile devicesüì¥üí≤

Uses user authentication, shared secret or certificate and a remote ID

___

## [OpenVPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVPN) ##

Open-source software and protocol.

Uses OpenSSL library to handle key exchange via **SSL/TLS** (offers 256 bit encryption) 

Creates a Layer 2 or Layer 3 connection. 

Via custom security protocol based on TLS. 

Uses TCP port 1194 by default, can be changed to other UDP/TCP ports. 

Works well through NAT and proxies.

‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è Widely recommended


___
### Other Protocols ###

## [Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Socket_Tunneling_Protocol) ##

Creates a secure channel using **SSL/TLS**

Uses **TCP port 443**

Fairly wide support 

Creates a client-network connection

## [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com) ##

Software and protocol (offers high security) 

Out-of-band key exchange (keys are assigned to peers in configuration)

Creates Layer 2 and Layer 3 connections over IP

Packets are encrypted with the public key of the destination host

Open source, with a goal of easy auditability

Not considered finalized (yet) [WireGuard.com](https://www.wireguard.com)

## [SoftEther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoftEther_VPN) ##

Software Ethernet

Offers IPsec, SSTP, and other protocols, in addition to its own protocol

Sends traffic through HTTPS

Offers Layer 2 and Layer 3 connections

Creates virtualized Ethernet devices

Open source [softether.com](https://www.softether.org)


___

## [SSH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell) FORWARDING ##

Secure Shell 

Create a connection to an SSH server for port forwarding

Uses TCP port 22 but can use other ports 

Can forward a local port to a remote port (connect localhost:8080 to server:80)

Some implementations can open a local port and act as a SOCKS proxy sending traffic to the server


SSH doesnt create network interfaces 

Very useful for certain cases 

Widespored and difficult to block


___

## üö¶TRANSFERING A FILE SECURELY WITH SCP AND SFTPüóÉÔ∏èüîêüö¶ ##

Transferring files should be confidentially encrypted to secure zero tampering while in transit.
FTP <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">[File Transfer Protoco]</a>  was not concieved with proper encryption, hence SFTP is prefered.

In this guide i propose two different commandline linux solutions for encrypted file transfer, SFTP (recommended) and SCP (outdated / not-recommended). 

We are using scp even if it is outdated, for learning purposes.

### Requirements ###

Two (linux) host machines either being localüèöÔ∏è or remoteüå•Ô∏è (doesn't make a difference).

[i run two seperate hosts on vmware (community/free) locally]
 
**[IPv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) addresses (IP addresses)** of the two machinesüñ•Ô∏è running linux (preferrable ubuntu servers).

You can find the ip address with ```ifconfig``` look at eth0 and inet.

or 

use ```ip a``` and look for inet.
Basic knowledge of bash command line scripting and perhaps (networking).
___
#### !NETWORK SETUP! ####

On both hosts add a user1 or use another user to send recieve files.

Create a user named "user1"
```bash
adduser user1
```
switch user to "user1"
```bash
su - user1
```
___
### CODE IMPLEMENTATION ###


#### FILE TRASNFER USING SCP(outdated) ####

ON SENDING HOST
```cd``` into the /home/user1 directory
create a file using ```nano``` 
```bash
cd /home/user1
 ```
create a file using ```nano``` 
```bash
nano file.txt
 ```
add some txt
```txt
hello world
```

(not-recommended) use scp to transfer the file.txt
```bash
scp file.txt user1@<ip address>:/home/user1
```
[in my local setup] i use ipv4 address: ```172.16.196.134``` for the recieving server
```bash
scp file.txt user1@$172.16.196.134:/home/user1
```

#### Verify the result on the recieving server ####

ON RECIEVING HOST

```bash
su - user1
```
```bash
cd /home/user1/
```
check if the file.txt appears
```bash
ls 
```
```bash
nano file.txt
```

If the text matches ```hello world```, congratulations you are done‚úîÔ∏è.

## Kerboros (protocol) ü¶Æü¶Æü¶Æ
[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/npNXXRAvMpU/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npNXXRAvMpU&t=524s)
AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM | CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT | SINGLE SIGN ON (SSO)

Preventing potential threat actors from sniffing any enterprise confidential information can be handle with Kerberos, while maintaining high availability to critical to employee resources.

**[Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/)**  a network authentication protocol [Free], offers usability through it's Ticket Granting System/Ticket based authentication. It uses [symmetric-key cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol)) and requires a trusted third party and optionally may use public-key cryptography during certain phases of communication.

Uses UDP port 88 as default.


### Kerberos from the inside

 Use Case: End user wishes to gain access to a service supporting Kerberos (Kerberized Service).

 1. End Userüñ•Ô∏è uses **Kerberos client** on their system with *username* & *password*
 2. **Kerberos client** creates *authentication request* in clear text to **authentication server**
 3. **Authentication server** looks up *user* in its *database* and retrieves user's *password*
 4. **Authentication server** sends two messages back to client:
    1. **TGS session key** randomly generated session key for **Kerberos Client** and **Ticket Granting Server** [Message is encrypted using the clients *password*].
    2. **Ticket Granting Ticket** includes information about the **Kerberos Client** and a copy of the client's **TGS session key**.
   Message is encrypted with a key only known to the **ticket-granting server**.
 5. **Kerberos Client** recieves the messages:
    1. Decrypts message using the user's *password*.
    2. This provides access to the **TGS session key** [without correct password, you wont get further].

## üö¶IMPLEMENTING KERBEROSüö¶ ##

#### KERBEROS SERVER / Key Distribution Center (KDC) üè∞ ####



Open the hosts file.
```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```
add
```txt
127.0.0.1 kdc.example.com
```
to the following to the ip address list so it looks something like this:
```txt
127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.1.1 ldap
127.0.0.1 kdc.example.com
```

save the file and start installing.
```bash
sudo apt get update
sudo apt install krb5-kdc krb5-admin-server
``` 
Default Kerberos version 5 realm (realm needs to be capital letters):
```txt
EXAMPLE.COM
``` 
Kerberos servers for your realm:
 ```txt
kdc.example.com
```
 Administrative server for your Kerberos realm:      
 ```txt
kdc.example.com
```
**üõëüîê!! PROCTECT THE MASTER KEY !!üîêüõë**
to create the example.com realm run the following command
and you will be prompted to enter a master key, which is very important to store in safe manner.
```bash
sudo krb5_newrealm
```
add a user to manage centrally
```bash
sudo kadmin.local 
```
add a principal, this is what user and services are called 
```bash
addprinc simon 
```
enter a password twice and write 'exit to exit
```bash
exit
```

  edit /etc/krb5.conf file & add the following lines in [domain_realm] section
```txt
.kdc.com = kdc.example.com
kdc.com = kdc.example.com
```

#### CLIENT üñ•Ô∏è ####

```bash
sudo apt get update
sudo apt install krb5-user krb5-config
```
create a file called etc krb5.conf
```bash
dpkg-reconfigure krb5-config
```
Default Kerberos version 5 realm:
```txt
EXAMPLE.COM
```
look at the krb5.conf file and configure (based on your setup perhaps automation tools)
```bash
cat /etc/krb5.confl
```
we will edit /etc/krb5.conf file & add the following lines in [domain_realm] section
```txt
.example.com = kdc.example.com
example.com = kdc.example.com
```

**check if we can communicate with the Kerberos server /KDC** 

```bash
kinit -p simon@EXAMPLE.COM
```
list the details of the ticket with
```bash
klist
```
**Client is ready to request Ticket Granting Server**

## Configuring the system access 
We need to configure access on the system that corresponds to the Kerberos Principle.
Add a user simon
```bash
adduser simon
```
in order to let someone log in, the system needs an account for them to use.
Kerberos should handle the authentication/password and the activation of the user's account on that machine. The kerberos user will map onto the local user when they log in.
[PAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_PAM) support is added for our Kerberized user:
```bash
sudo apt install libpam-krb5.
```
see and control the inclusion of Kerboros in the PAM files:
```bash
grep krb /etc/pam.d/*
```
**Log in as Kerberized user**

Sign in again to the host/virtual machine, switch to a new console.
After signing in use:
```bash
klist
```
verify you get information about the Kerberos Ticket:
```bash

```
#### PROTECTED SERVER üì≠ ####

```bash
sudo apt install krb5 config
```

Edit ***/etc/ssh/sshd_config***

add ***yes*** to following lines:

```txt
GSSAPIAuthentication yes
GSSAPICleanupCredentials yes
```

```bash
restart!!!
```

### KERBEROS SERVER üè∞ ###

  add the ssh server to the kerberos management
  add principal 
  creat a key file
```bash
ktadd  k /tmp/sshserver.kea.dk.keytab
host/sshserver.kea.dk
```
  copy the keyfile to the ssh server /etc directory

```bash
```

### CLIENT üñ•Ô∏è ###

  get the ticket from the kerberos server
```bash
kinit root/admin
klist  A 
```


### SUMMARY OF SETUP ###

  install both kerberos server packages on kerboros server
  install kerberos client package
    add get a a ticket for the user that will login remotely
  on ssh server [protected server] 
    install krb5

## üìñ CRYPTOLOGY: HASHING WEAKNESS


Sources:
<p>  <a href="https://www.rfc editor.org/rfc/rfc8554.html">RFC 8554 </a> </p>

<p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function"> wikipedia. </a></p>

### 3 Weaknesses of Hashing ###



The hashing function must be deterministic in it's output given an input of arbritary size. 
This is the way hashing is used to encode data for more effcient memory utilization.

This is useful, but not the primer goal of hashing in cryptography.

While providing the effectiveness of hashing algorithm's ability to obfuscate information, like password storage in databases, many algorithms have proven to be weak to certain types of attacks.

Therefore, as always, we must carefully research and evalutate any security methodes, before bringing them to production environment.
According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function"> wikipedia <a> the following conditions are met in a secure hash function and it's corresponding output, such as SHA 3 and Argon2.

```
Pre image resistance
Given a hash value h, it should be difficult to find any message m such that h = hash(m). This concept is related to that of a one way function. Functions that lack this property are vulnerable to preimage attacks.
```
```
Second pre image resistance
Given an input m1, it should be difficult to find a different input m2 such that hash(m1) = hash(m2). This property is sometimes referred to as weak collision resistance. Functions that lack this property are vulnerable to second preimage attacks.
```
```
Collision resistance
It should be difficult to find two different messages m1 and m2 such that hash(m1) = hash(m2). Such a pair is called a cryptographic hash collision. This property is sometimes referred to as strong collision resistance. It requires a hash value at least twice as long as that required for pre image resistance; otherwise, collisions may be found by a birthday attack.
```

Attack vectors against hashes (output of the hash functions) count, birthday attacks, preimage attack, second preimage attack.

#### Security / Computational Speed Tradeoff ###

| HASH FUNCTION | SECURITY | SPEED 
| ------        | ------- |  ----- |
| SHA 1         | NOT SECURE | FAST |
| SHA 2         | HIGH    | FAST |
| SHA 3         |  HIGHEST | FAST |
| Argon2         | HIGEHST | SLOW | 
| SHA 256         | HIGH | FAST |
| SHA 512         | VERY HIGH | FAST | 

#### Tools used: ####


| Name |¬†Description | OS |
| ---     | ---            | --   |
| hash identifier | Identifies hash function algorithm based on an output/digest | Linux | 
| <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#input=SGVsbG8gd29ybGQ">Cyber Chef </a> | Online tool for calculating outputs/digests with all major cryptology algorithms | webbrowser |
| John The Ripper | Password cracking tool | Linux |
| Hash Cat | | Linux |




#### Birthday attack ####

Relates to the property, collision resistance. Given the output value, it should be extremely hard to calculate another input value. 

In the case of SHA 256, the security from birthday attacks is given by the 50% of hashing the same output given two distinct hash inputs.

SHA 256 algorithm output birthday attack security level is 2^(256/2) = 2^128 different inputs needed to collide with an existing hash output.

The security level against brithday attacks withing the SHA 1 algorithm output of 160 bits (not secure) is 2^(160/2) = 2^80 different inputs needed to collide with an existing hash output hashed with the same algorithm (SHA 1 of 160 bits).

#### Use Key Derivative Functions for password storage ####

Attackers can download a database of hashed password and attempt to crack the password by comparing salts from already known passwords, and thereby obtain access to matching passwords accounts.

Salting can to some extend prevent attackers success by adding an extra entry/element together with the hashed password. 

***Best practice*** is to couple salting with a Key Derivative Function.

***KDF's, take a key, salt, iterations as inputs.***
The goal is to slow down the process of attempts to bruteforce or use dictionary attakcs to obtain the password or passphrase of a victim.

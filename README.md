### 3 Weaknesses of Hashing 



The hashing function must be deterministic in it's output given an input of arbritary size. 
This is the way hashing is used to encode data for more effcient memory utilization.

This is useful, but not the primer goal of hashing in cryptography.

While providing the effectiveness of hashing algorithm's ability to obfuscate information, like password storage in databases, many algorithms have proven to be weak to certain types of attacks.

Therefore, as always, we must carefully research and evalutate any security methodes, before bringing them to production environment.
According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function"> wikipedia <a> the following conditions are met in a secure hash function and it's corresponding output, such as SHA-3 and Argon2.

```
Pre-image resistance
Given a hash value h, it should be difficult to find any message m such that h = hash(m). This concept is related to that of a one-way function. Functions that lack this property are vulnerable to preimage attacks.
```
```
Second pre-image resistance
Given an input m1, it should be difficult to find a different input m2 such that hash(m1) = hash(m2). This property is sometimes referred to as weak collision resistance. Functions that lack this property are vulnerable to second-preimage attacks.
```
```
Collision resistance
It should be difficult to find two different messages m1 and m2 such that hash(m1) = hash(m2). Such a pair is called a cryptographic hash collision. This property is sometimes referred to as strong collision resistance. It requires a hash value at least twice as long as that required for pre-image resistance; otherwise, collisions may be found by a birthday attack.
```

Attack vectors against hashes (output of the hash functions) count, birthday attacks, preimage-attack, second-preimage attack.

# How to achieve industry level security

| HASH FUNCTION | SECURITY | SPEED | 
|-------------- | -------- | ----- |
| SHA-1         | NOT SECURE | FAST |
| SHA-2         | HIGH| FAST |
| SHA-3         |  HIGHEST | FAST |
| Argon2         | HIGEHST | SLOW | 
| SHA-256         | HIGH | FAST |
| SHA-512         | VERY HIGH | FAST | 
| SHA-3         |  HIGHEST| |
| Argon2         | HIGEHST | |
|-------------- | -------| |

#### Birthday attack

Relates to the property, collision resistance. Given the output value, it should be extremely hard to calculate another input value. 

In the case of SHA-256, the security from birthday attacks is given by the 50% of hashing the same output given two distinct hash inputs.

SHA-256 algorithm output birthday attack security level is 2^(256/2) = 2^128 different inputs needed to collide with an existing hash output.

The security level against brithday attacks withing the SHA-1 algorithm output of 160 bits (not secure) is 2^(160/2) = 2^80 different inputs needed to collide with an existing hash output hashed with the same algorithm (SHA-1 of 160 bits).
